       "\"The following tribute from Trudy to her teacher describes very well the relationship between Zen teacher and Zen student: A roshi is a person who has actualized that perfect freedom which is the potentiality for all human beings. He exists freely in the fullness of his whole being. The flow of his consciousness is not the fixed repetitive patterns of our usual selfcentered consciousness, but rather arises spontaneously and naturally from the actual circumstances of the present. The results of this in terms of the quality of his life are extraordinary buoyancy, vigor, straightforwardness, simplicity, humility, serenity, joyousness, uncanny perspicacity and unfathomable compassion. His whole being testifies to what it means to live in the reality of the present. Without anything said or done, just the impact of meeting a personality so developed can be enough to change another's whole way of life. But in the end it is not the extraordinariness of the teacher which perplexes, intrigues, and deepens the student, it is the teacher's utter ordinariness. Because he is just himself, he is a mirror for his students. When we are with him we feel our own strengths and shortcomings without any sense of praise or criticism from him. In his presence we see our original face, and the extraordinariness we see is only our own true nature. When we learn to let our own nature free, the boundaries between master and student disappear in a deep flow of being and joy in the unfolding of Buddha mind. , ' It is wisdom which is seeking for wisdom. Kyoto, ' In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, hut in the expert's there are few. People say that practicing Zen is difficult, but there is a misunderstanding as to why. It is not difficult because it is hard to sit in the crosslegged position, or to attain enlightenment. It is difficult because it is hard to keep our mind pure and our practice pure in its fundamental sense. The Zen school developed in many ways after it was established in China, but at the same time, it became more and more impure. But I do not want to talk about Chinese Zen or the history of Zen. I am interested in helping you keep your practice from becoming impure. In Japan we have the phrase shoshin, which means beginner's mind. The goal of practice is always to keep our beginner's mind. Suppose you recite the Prajna Paramita Sutra only once. It might be a very good recitation. But what would happen to you if you recited it twice, three times, four times, or more You might easily lose your original attitude towards it. The same thing will happen in your other Zen practices. For a while you will keep your beginner's mind, but if you continue to practice one, two, three years or more, although you may improve some, you are liable to lose the limitless meaning of original mind. For Zen students the most important thing is not to be dualistic. Our original mind includes everything within itself. It is always rich and sufficient within itself. You should not lose your selfsufficient state of mind. This does not mean a closed mind, but actually an empty mind and a ready mind. If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything it is open to everything. In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities in the expert's mind there are few. If you discriminate too much, you limit yourself. If you are too demanding or too greedy, your mind is not rich and selfsufficient. If we lose our original selfsufficient mind, we will lose all precepts. When your mind becomes demanding, when you long for something, you will end up violating your own precepts: not to tell lies, not to steal, not to kill, not to be immoral, and so forth. If you keep your original mind, the precepts will keep themselves. In the beginner's mind there is no thought, I have attained something. All selfcentered thoughts limit our vast mind. When we have no thought of achievement, no thought of self, we are true beginners. Then we can really learn something. The beginner's mind is the mind of compassion. When our mind is compassionate, it is boundless. Dogenzenji, the founder of our school, always emphasized how important it is to resume our boundless original mind. Then we are always true to ourselves, in sympathy with all beings, and can actually practice. So the most difficult thing is always to keep your beginner's mind. There is no need to have a deep understanding of Zen. Even though you read much Zen literature, you must read each sentence with a fresh mind. You should not say, I know what Zen is, or I have attained enlightenment. This is also the real secret of the arts: always be a beginner. Be very very careful about this point. If you start to practice zazen, you will begin to appreciate your beginner's mind. It is the secret of Zen practice. Zazen practice is the direct expression of our true nature. Strictly speaking, for a human being, there is no other practice than this practice there is no other way of life than this way of life. These forms are not the means of obtaining the right state of mind. To take this posture is itself to have the right state of mind. There is no need to obtain some special state of mind. Now I would like to talk about our zazen posture. When you sit in the full lotus position, your left foot is on your right thigh, and your right foot is on your left thigh. When we cross our legs like this, even though we have a right leg and a left leg, they have become one. The position expresses the oneness of duality: not two, and not one. This is the most important teaching: not two, and not one. Our body and mind are not two and not one. If you think your body and mind are two, that is wrong if you think that they are one, that is also wrong. Our body and mind are both two and one. We usually think that if something is not one, it is more than one if it is not singular, it is plural. But in actual experience, our life is not only plural, but also singular. Each one of us is both dependent and independent. After some years we will die. If we just think that it is the end of our life, this will be the wrong understanding. But, on the other hand, if we think that we do not die, this is also wrong. We die, and we do not die. This is the right understanding. Some people may say that our mind or soul exists forever, and it is only our physical body which dies. But this is not exactly right, because both mind and body have their end. But at the same time it is also true that they exist eternally. And even though we say mind and body, they are actually two sides of one coin. This is the right understanding. So when we take this posture it symbolizes this truth. When I have the left foot on the right side of my body, and the right foot on the left side of my body, I do not know which is which. So either may be the left or the right side. The most important thing in taking the zazen posture is to keep your spine straight. Your ears and your shoulders should be on one line. Relax your shoulders, and push up towards the ceiling with the back of your head. And you should pull your chin in. When your chin is tilted up, you have no strength in your posture you are probably dreaming. Also to gain strength in your posture, press your diaphragm down towards your hara, or lower abdomen. This will help you maintain your physical and mental balance. When you try to keep this posture, at first you may find some difficulty breathing naturally, but when you get accustomed to it you will be able to breathe naturally and deeply. Your hands should form the cosmic mudra. If you put your left hand on top of your right, middle joints of your middle fingers together, and touch your thumbs lightly together as if you held a piece of paper between them, your hands will make a beautiful oval. You should keep this universal mudra with great care, as if you were holding something very precious in your hand. Your hands should be held against your body, with your thumbs at about the height of your navel. Hold your arms freely and easily, and slightly away from your body, as if you held an egg under each arm without breaking it. You should not be tilted sideways, backwards, or forwards. You should be sitting straight up as if you were supporting the sky with your head. This is not just form or breathing. It expresses the key point of Buddhism. It is a perfect expression of your Buddha nature. If you want true understanding of Buddhism, you should practice this way. These forms are not a means of obtaining the right state of mind. To take this posture itself is the purpose of our practice. When you have this posture, you have the right state of mind, so there is no need to try to attain some special state. When you try to attain something, your mind starts to wander about somewhere else. When you do not try to attain anything, you have your own body and mind right here. A Zen master would say, Kill the Buddha! Kill the Buddha if the Buddha exists somewhere else. Kill the Buddha, because you should resume your own Buddha nature. Doing something is expressing our own nature. We do not exist for the sake of something else. We exist for the sake of ourselves. This is the fundamental teaching expressed in the forms we observe. Just as for sitting, when we stand in the zendo we have some rules. But the purpose of these rules is not to make everyone the same, but to allow each to express his own self most freely. For instance, each one of us has his own way of standing, so our standing posture is based on the proportions of our own bodies. When you stand, your heels should be as far apart as the width of your own fist, your big toes in line with the centers of your breasts. As in zazen, put some strength in your abdomen. Here also your hands should express your self. Hold your left hand against your chest with fingers encircling your thumb, and put your right hand over it. Holding your thumb pointing downward, and your forearms parallel to the floor, you feel as if you have some round pillar in your grasp a big round temple pillar so you cannot be slumped or tilted to the side. The most important point is to own your own physical body. If you slump, you will lose your self. Your mind will be wandering about somewhere else you will not be in your body. This is not the way. We must exist right here, right now! This is the key point. You must have your own body and mind. Everything should exist in the right place, in the right way. Then there is no problem. If the microphone I use when I speak exists somewhere else, it will not serve its purpose. When we have our body and mind in order, everything else will exist in the right place, in the right way. But usually, without being aware of it, we try to change something other than ourselves, we try to order things outside us. But it is impossible to organize things if you yourself are not in order. When you do things in the right way, at the right time, everything else will be organized. You are the boss. When the boss is sleeping, everyone is sleeping. When the boss does something right, everyone will do everything right, and at the right time. That is the secret of Buddhism. So try always to keep the right posture, not only when you practice zazen, but in all your activities. Take the right posture when you are driving your car, and when you are reading. If you read in a slumped position, you cannot stay awake long. Try. You will discover how important it is to keep the right posture. This is the true teaching. The teaching which is written on paper is not the true teaching. Written teaching is a kind of food for your brain. Of course it is necessary to take some food for your brain, but it is more important to be yourself by practicing the right way of life. That is why Buddha could not accept the religions existing at his time. He studied many religions, but he was not satisfied with their practices. He could not find the answer in asceticism or in philosophies. He was not interested in some metaphysical existence, but in his own body and mind, here and now. And when he found himself, he found that everything that exists has Buddha nature. That was his enlightenment. Enlightenment is not some good feeling or some particular state of mind. The state of mind that exists when you sit in the right posture is, itself, enlightenment. If you cannot be satisfied with the state of mind you have in zazen, it means your mind is still wandering about. Our body and mind should not be wobbling or wandering about. In this posture there is no need to talk about the right state of mind. You already have it. This is the conclusion of Buddhism. What we call is just a swinging door which moves when we inhale and when we exhale. When we practice zazen our mind always follows our breathing. When we inhale, the air comes into the inner world. When we exhale, the air goes out to the outer world. The inner world is limitless, and the outer world is also limitless. We say inner world or outer world, but actually there is just one whole world. In this limitless world, our throat is like a swinging door. The air comes in and goes out like someone passing through a swinging door. If you think, I breathe, the I is extra. There is no you to say . What we call I is just a swinging door which moves when we inhale and when we exhale. It just moves that is all. When your mind is pure and calm enough to follow this movement, there is nothing: no , no world, no mind nor body just a swinging door. So when we practice zazen, all that exists is the movement of the breathing, but we are aware of this movement. You should not be absentminded. But to be aware of the movement does not mean to be aware of your small self, but rather of your universal nature, or Buddha nature. This kind of awareness is very important, because we are usually so onesided. Our usual understanding of life is dualistic: you and , this and that, good and bad. But actually these discriminations are themselves the awareness of the universal existence. You means to be aware of the universe in the form of you, and I means to be aware of it in the form of . You and I are just swinging doors. This kind of understanding is necessary. This should not even be called understanding it is actually the true experience of life through Zen practice. So when you practice zazen, there is no idea of time or space. You may say, We started sitting at a quarter to six in this room. Thus you have some idea of time a quarter to six, and some idea of space in this room. Actually what you are doing, however, is just sitting and being aware of the universal activity. That is all. This moment the swinging door is opening in one direction, and the next moment the swinging door will be opening in the opposite direction. Moment after moment each one of us repeats this activity. Here there is no idea of time or space. Time and space are one. You may say, I must do something this afternoon, but actually there is no this afternoon. We do things one after the other. That is all. There is no such time as this afternoon or one o'clock or two o'clock. At one o'clock you will eat your lunch. To eat lunch is itself one o'clock. You will be somewhere, but that place cannot be separated from one o'clock. For someone who actually appreciates our life, they are the same. But when we become tired of our life we may say, I shouldn't have come to this place. It may have been much better to have gone to some other place for lunch. This place is not so good. In your mind you create an idea of place separate from an actual time. Or you may say, This is bad, so I should not do this. Actually, when you say, I should not do this, you are doing notdoing in that moment. So there is no choice for you. When you separate the idea of time and space, you feel as if you have some choice, but actually, you have to do something, or you have to do notdoing. Nottodo something is doing something. Good and bad are only in your mind. So we should not say, This is good, or This is bad. Instead of saying bad, you should say, nottodo ! If you think, This is bad, it will create some confusion for you. So in the realm of pure religion there is no confusion of time and space, or good or bad. All that we should do is just do something as it comes. Do something! Whatever it is, we should do it, even if it is notdoing something. We should live in this moment. So when we sit we concentrate on our breathing, and we become a swinging door, and we do something we should do, something we must do. This is Zen practice. In this practice there is no confusion. If you establish this kind of life you have no confusion whatsoever. Tozan, a famous Zen master, said, The blue mountain is the father of the white cloud. The white cloud is the son of the blue mountain. All day long they depend on each other, without being dependent on each other. The white cloud is always the white cloud. The blue mountain is always the blue mountain. This is a pure, clear interpretation of life. There may be many things like the white cloud and blue mountain: man and woman, teacher and disciple. They depend on each other. But the white cloud should not be bothered by the blue mountain. The blue mountain should not be bothered by the white cloud. They are quite independent, but yet dependent. This is how we live, and how we practice zazen. When we become truly ourselves, we just become a swinging door, and we are purely independent of, and at the same time, dependent upon everything. Without air, we cannot breathe. Each one of us is in the midst of myriads of worlds. We are in the center of the world always, moment after moment. So we are completely dependent and independent. If you have this kind of experience, this kind of existence, you have absolute independence you will not be bothered by anything. So when you practice zazen, your mind should be concentrated on your breathing. This kind of activity is the fundamental activity of the universal being. Without this experience, this practice, it is impossible to attain absolute freedom. C L To give jour sheep or cow a large, spacious meadow is the way to control him. To live in the realm of Buddha nature means to die as a small being, moment after moment. When we lose our balance I H L we die, but at the same time we also develop ourselves, we grow. Whatever we see is changing, losing its balance. The reason everything looks beautiful is because it is out of balance, but its background is always in perfect harmony. This is how everything exists in the realm of Buddha nature, losing its balance against a background of perfect balance. So if you see things without realizing the background of Buddha nature, everything appears to be in the form of suffering. But if you understand the background of existence, you realize that suffering itself is how we live, and how we extend our life. So in Zen sometimes we emphasize the imbalance or disorder of life. Nowadays traditional Japanese painting has become pretty formal and lifeless. That is why modern art has developed. Ancient painters used to practice putting dots on paper in artistic disorder. This is rather difficult. Even though you try to do it, usually what you do is arranged in some order. You think you can control it, but you cannot it is almost impossible to arrange your dots out of order. It is the same with taking care of your everyday life. Even though you try to put people under some control, it is impossible. You cannot do it. The best way to control people is to encourage them to be mischievous. Then they will be in control in its wider sense. To give your sheep or cow a large, spacious meadow is the way to control him. So it is with people: first let them do what they want, and watch them. This is the best policy. To ignore them is not good that is the worst policy. The second worst is trying to control them. The best one is to watch them, just to watch them, without trying to control them. The same way works for you yourself as well. If you want to obtain perfect calmness in your zazen, you should not be bothered by the various images you find in your mind. Let them come, and let them go. Then they will be under control. But this policy is not so easy. It sounds easy, but it requires some special effort. How to make this kind of effort is the secret of practice. Suppose you are sitting under some extraordinary circumstances. If you try to calm your mind you will be unable to sit, and if you try not to be disturbed, your effort will not be the right effort. The only effort that will help you is to count your breathing, or to concentrate on your inhaling and exhaling. We say concentration, but to concentrate your mind on something is not the true purpose of Zen. The true purpose is to see things as they are, to observe things as they are, and to let everything go as it goes. This is to put everything under control in its widest sense. Zen practice is to open up our small mind. So concentrating is just an aid to help you realize big mind, or the mind that is everything. If you want to discover the true meaning of Zen in your everyday life, you have to understand the meaning of keeping your mind on your breathing and your body in the right posture in zazen. You should follow the rules of practice and your study should become more subtle and careful. Only in this way can you experience the vital freedom of Zen. Dogenzenji said, Time goes from present to past. This is absurd, but in our practice sometimes it is true. Instead of time progressing from past to present, it goes backwards from present to past. Yoshitsune was a famous warrior who lived in medieval Japan. Because of the situation of the country at that time, he was sent to the northern provinces, where he was killed. Before he left he bade farewell to his wife, and soon after she wrote in a poem, Just as you unreel the thread from a spool, I want the past to become present. When she said this, actually she made past time present. In her mind the past became alive and was the present. So as Dogen said, Time goes from present to past. This is not true in our logical mind, but it is in the actual experience of making past time present. There we have poetry, and there we have human life. When we experience this kind of truth it means we have found the true meaning of time. Time constantly goes from past to present and from present to future. This is true, but it is also true that time goes from future to present and from L present to past. A Zen master once said, To go eastward one mile is to go westward one mile. This is vital freedom. We should acquire this kind of perfect freedom. But perfect freedom is not found without some rules. People, especially young people, think that freedom is to do just what they want, that in Zen there is no need for rules. But it is absolutely necessary for us to have some rules. But this does not mean always to be under control. As long as you have rules, you have a chance for freedom. To try to obtain freedom without being aware of the rules means nothing. It is to acquire this perfect freedom that we practice zazen. M Because we enjoy all aspects of life as an unfolding of big mind, we do not care for any excessive joy. So we have imperturbable composure. When you are practicing zazen, do not try to stop your thinking. Let it stop by itself. If something comes into your mind, let it come in, and let it go out. It will not stay long. When you try to stop your thinking, it means you are bothered by it. Do not be bothered by anything. It appears as if something comes from outside your mind, but actually it is only the waves of your mind, and if you are not bothered by the waves, gradually they will become calmer and calmer. In five or at most ten minutes, your mind will be completely serene and calm. At that time your breathing will become quite slow, while your pulse will become a little faster. It will take quite a long time before you find your calm, serene mind in your practice. Many sensations come, many thoughts or images arise, but they are just waves of your own mind. Nothing comes from outside your mind. Usually we think of our mind as receiving impressions and experiences from outside, but that is not a true understanding of our mind. The true understanding is that the mind includes everything when you think something comes from outside it means only that something appears in your mind. Nothing outside yourself can cause any trouble. You yourself make the waves in your mind. If you leave your mind as it is, it will become calm. This mind is called big mind. If your mind is related to something outside itself, that mind is a small mind, a limited mind. If your mind is not related to anything else, then there is no dualistic understanding in the activity of your mind. You understand activity as just waves of your mind. Big mind experiences everything within itself. Do you understand the difference between the two minds: the mind which includes everything, and the mind which is related to something Actually they are the same thing, but the understanding is different, and your attitude towards your life will be different according to which understanding you have. That everything is included within your mind is the essence of mind. To experience this is to have religious feeling. Even though waves arise, the essence of your mind is pure it is just like clear water with a few waves. Actually water always has waves. Waves are the practice of the water.. To speak of waves apart from water or water apart from waves is a delusion. Water and waves are one. Big mind and small mind are one. When you understand your mind in this way, you have some security in your feeling. As your mind does not expect anything from outside, it is always filled. A mind with waves in it is not a disturbed mind, but actually an amplified one. Whatever you experience is an expression of big mind. The activity of big mind is to amplify itself through various experiences. In one sense our experiences coming one by one are always fresh and new, but in another sense they are nothing but a continuous or repeated unfolding of the one big mind. For instance, if you have something good for breakfast, you will say, This is good. Good is supplied as something experienced some time long ago, even though you may not remember when. With big mind we accept each of our experiences as if recognizing the face we see in a mirror as our own. For us there is no fear of losing this mind. There is nowhere to come or to go there is no fear of death, no suffering from old age or sickness. Because we enjoy all aspects of life as an unfolding of big mind, we do not care for any excessive joy. So we have imperturbable composure, and it is with this imperturbable composure of big mind that we practice zazen. M should rather V grateful for the weeds you have in jour mind, because eventually they will enrich your practice. When the alarm rings early in the morning, and you get up, I think you do not feel so good. It is not easy to go and sit, and even after you arrive at the zendo and begin zazen you have to encourage yourself to sit well. These are just waves of your mind. In pure zazen there should not be any waves in your mind. While you are sitting these waves will become smaller and smaller, and your effort will change into some subtle feeling. We say, Pulling out the weeds we give nourishment to the plant. We pull the weeds and bury them near the plant to give it nourishment. So even though you have some difficulty in your practice, even though you have some waves while you are sitting, those waves themselves will help you. So you should not be bothered by your mind. You should rather be grateful for the weeds, because eventually they will enrich your practice. If you have some experience of how the weeds in your mind change into mental nourishment, your practice will make remarkable progress. You will feel the progress. You will feel how they change into selfnourishment. Of course it is not so difficult to give some philosophical or psychological interpretation of our prac tice, but that is not enough. We must have the actual experience of how our weeds change into nourishment. Strictly speaking, any effort we make is not good for our practice because it creates waves in our mind. It is impossible, however, to attain absolute calmness of our mind without any effort. We must make some effort, but we must forget ourselves in the effort we make. In this realm there is no subjectivity or objectivity. Our mind is just calm, without even any awareness. In this unawareness, every effort and every idea and thought will vanish. So it is necessary for us to encourage ourselves and to make an effort up to the last moment, when all effort disappears. You should keep your mind on your breathing until you are not aware of your breathing. We should try to continue our effort forever, but we should not expect to reach some stage when we will forget all about it. We should just try to keep our mind on our breathing. That is our actual practice. That effort will be refined more and more while you are sitting. At first the effort you make is quite rough and impure, but by the power of practice the effort will become purer and purer. When your effort becomes pure, your body and mind become pure. This is the way we practice Zen. Once you understand our innate power to purify ourselves and our surroundings, you can act properly, and you will learn from those around you, and you will become friendly with others. This is the merit of Zen practice. But the way of practice is just to be concentrated on your breathing with the right posture and with great, pure effort. This is how we practice Zen. W F In the zazen posture, your mind and body have, A reat power to accept things as they are, whether agreeable or disagreeable In our scriptures Samyuktagama Sutra, volume , it is said that there are four kinds of horses: excellent ones, good ones, poor ones, and bad ones. The best horse will run slow and fast, right and left, at the driver's will, before it sees the shadow of the whip the second best will run as well as the first one does, just before the whip reaches its skin the third one will run when it feels pain on its body the fourth will run after the pain penetrates to the marrow ofits bones. You can imagine how difficult it is for the fourth one to learn how to run! When we hear this story, almost all of us want to be the best horse. If it is impossible to be the best one, we want to be the second best. This is, I think, the usual understanding of this story, and of Zen. You may think that when you sit in zazen you will find out whether you are one of the best horses or one of the worst ones. Here, however, there is a misunderstanding of Zen. If you think the aim of Zen practice is to train you to become one of the best horses, you will have a big problem. This is not the right understanding. If you practice Zen in the right way it does not matter whether you are the best horse or the worst one. When you consider the mercy of Buddha, how do you think Buddha will feel about the four kinds of horses He will have more sympathy for the worst one than for the best one. When you are determined to practice zazen with the great mind of Buddha, you will find the worst horse is the most valuable one. In your very imperfections you will find the basis for your firm, wayseeking mind. Those who can sit perfectly physically usually take more time to obtain the true way of Zen, the actual feeling of Zen, the marrow of Zen. But those who find great difficulties in practicing Zen will find more meaning in it. So I think that sometimes the best horse may be the worst horse, and the worst horse can be the best one. If you study calligraphy you will find that those who are not so clever usually become the best calligraphers. Those who are very clever with their hands often encounter great difficulty after they have reached a certain stage. This is also true in art and in Zen. It is true in life. So when we talk about Zen we cannot say, He is good, or He is bad, in the ordinary sense of the words. The posture taken in zazen is not the same for each of us. For some it may be impossible to take the crosslegged posture. But even though you cannot take the right posture, when you arouse your real, wayseeking mind, you can practice Zen in its true sense. Actually it is easier for those who have difficulties in sitting to arouse the true wayseeking mind than for those who can sit easily. When we reflect on what are doing in our everyday life, we are always ashamed of ourselves. One of my students wrote to me saying, You sent me a calendar, and I am trying to follow the good mottoes which appear on each page. But the year has hardly begun, and already I have failed! Dogenzenji said,' 'Shoshaku jushaku. Shaku generally means mistake or wrong. Shoshaku jushaku means to succeed wrong with wrong, or one continuous mistake. According to Dogen, one continuous mistake can also be Zen. A Zen master's life could be said to be so many years of shoshaku jushaku. This means so many years of one singleminded effort. We say, A good father is not a good father. Do you understand One who thinks he is a good father is not a good father one who thinks he is a good husband is not a good husband. One who thinks he is one of the worst husbands may be a good one if he is always trying to be a good husband with a singlehearted effort. If you find it impossible to sit because of some pain or some physical difficulty, then you should sit anyway, using a thick cushion or a chair. W F Even though you are the worst horse you will get to the marrow of Zen. Suppose your children are suffering from a hopeless disease. You do not know what to do you cannot lie in bed. Normally the most comfortable place for you would be a warm comfortable bed, but now because of your mental agony you cannot rest. You may walk up and down, in and out, but this does not help. Actually the best way to relieve your mental suffering is to sit in zazen, even in such a confused state of mind and bad posture. If you have no experience of sitting in this kind of difficult situation you are not a Zen student. No other activity will appease your suffering. In other restless positions you have no power to accept your difficulties, but in the zazen posture which you have acquired by long, hard practice, your mind and body have great power to accept things as they are, whether they are agreeable or disagreeable. When you feel disagreeable it is better for you to sit. There is no other way to accept your problem and work on it. Whether you are the best horse or the worst, or whether your posture is good or bad is out of the question. Everyone can practice zazen, and in this way work on his problems and accept them. When you are sitting in the middle of your own problem, which is more real to you: your problem or you yourself The awareness that you are here, right now, is the ultimate fact. This is the point you will realize by zazen practice. In continuous practice, under a succession of agreeable and disagreeable situations, you will realize the marrow of Zen and acquire its true strength. M To stop jour mind does not mean to stop the activities of mind. It means jour mind penades jour whole bodj. With jour full mind joujorm the mudra in jour hands. We say ourpractice should be without gaining ideas, without any expectations, even of enlightenment. This does not mean, however, just to sit without any purpose. This practice free from gaining ideas is based on the Prajna Paramita Sutra. However, if you are not careful the sutra itself will give you a gaining idea. It says, Form is emptiness and emptiness is form. But if you attach to that statement, you are liable to be involved in dualistic ideas: here is you, form, and here is emptiness, which you are trying to realize through your form. So form is emptiness, and emptiness is form is still dualistic. But fortunately, our teaching goes on to say, Form is form and emptiness is emptiness. Here there is no dualism. When you find it difficult to stop your mind while you are sitting and when you are still trying to stop your mind, this is the stage of form is emptiness and emptiness is form. But while you are practicing in this dualistic way, more and more you will have oneness with your goal. And when your practice becomes effortless, you can stop your mind. This is the stage of form is form and emptiness is emptiness. To stop your mind does not mean to stop the activities of mind. It means your mind pervades your whole body. Your mind follows your breathing. With your full mind you form the mudra in your hands. With your whole mind you sit with painful legs without being disturbed by them. This is to sit without any gaining idea. At first you feel some restriction in your posture, but when you are not disturbed by the restriction, you have found the meaning of emptiness is emptiness and form is form. So to find your own way under some restriction is the way of practice. Practice does not mean that whatever you do, even lying down, is zazen. When the restrictions you have do not limit M you, this is what we mean by practice. When you say, Whatever I do is Buddha nature, so it doesn't matter what I do, and there is no need to practice zazen, that is already a dualistic understanding of our everyday life. If it really does not matter, there is no need for you even to say so. As long as you are concerned about what you do, that is dualistic. If you are not concerned about what you do, you will not say so. When you sit, you will sit. When you eat, you will eat. That is all. If you say, It doesn't matter, it means that you are making some excuse to do something in your own way with your small mind. It means you are attached to some particular thing or way. That is not what we mean when we say, Just to sit is enough, or Whatever you do is zazen. Of course whatever we do is zazen, but if so, there is no need to say it. When you sit, you should just sit without being disturbed by your painful legs or sleepiness. That is zazen. But at first it is very difficult to accept things as they are. You will be annoyed by the feeling you have in your practice. When you can do everything, whether it is good or bad, without disturbance or without being annoyed by the feeling, that is actually what we mean by form is form and emptiness is emptiness. When you suffer from an illness like cancer, and you realize you cannot live more than two or three years, then seeking something upon which to rely, you may start practice. One person may rely on the help of God. Someone else may start the practice of zazen. His practice will be concentrated on obtaining emptiness of mind. That means he is trying to be free from the suffering of duality. This is the practice of form is emptiness and emptiness is form. Because of the truth of emptiness, he wants to have the actual realization of it in his life. If he practices in this way, believing and making an effort, it will help him, of course, but it is not perfect practice. Knowing that your life is short, to enjoy it day after day, moment after moment, is the life of form is form, and emptiness emptiness. When Buddha comes, you will welcome him when the devil comes, you will welcome him. The famous Chinese Zen master Ummon, said, Sunfaced Buddha and moonfaced Buddha. When he was ill, someone asked him, How are you And he answered, Sunfaced Buddha and moonfaced Buddha. That is the life of form is form and emptiness is emptiness. There is no problem. One year of life is good. One hundred years of life are good. If you continue our practice, you will attain this stage. At first you will have various problems, and it is necessary for you to make some effort to continue our practice. For the beginner, practice without effort is not true practice. For the beginner, the practice needs great effort. Especially for young people, it is necessary to try very hard to achieve something. You must stretch out your arms and legs as wide as they will go. Form is form. You must be true to your own way until at last you actually come to the point where you see it is necessary to forget all about yourself. Until you come to this point, it is completely mistaken to think that whatever you do is Zen or that it does not matter whether you practice or not. But if you make your best effort just to continue yourpractice with your whole mind and body, without gaining ideas, then whatever you do will be true practice. Just to continue should be your purpose. When you do something, just to do it should be your purpose. Form is form and you are you, and true emptiness will be realized in your practice. Bowing is a very serious practice. You should be prepared to bow, even in jour last moment. Even though it is impossible to get rid of our selfcentered desires, we have to do it. Our true nature wants us to. After zazen we bow to the floor nine times. By bowing we are giving up ourselves. To give up ourselves means to give up our dualistic ideas. So there is no difference between zazen practice and bowing. Usually to bow means to pay our respects to something which is more worthy of respect than ourselves. But when you bow to Buddha you should have no idea of Buddha, you just become one with Buddha, you are already Buddha himself. When you become one with Buddha, one with everything that exists, you find the true meaning of being. When you forget all your dualistic ideas, everything becomes your teacher, and everything can be the object of worship. When everything exists within your big mind, all dualistic relationships drop away. There is no distinction between heaven and earth, man and woman, teacher and disciple. Sometimes a man bows to a woman sometimes a woman bows to a man. Sometimes the disciple bows to the master sometimes the master bows to the disciple. A master who cannot bow to his disciple cannot bow to Buddha. Sometimes the master and disciple bow together to Buddha. Sometimes we may bow to cats and dogs. In your big mind, everything has the same value. Everything is Buddha himself. You see something or hear a sound, and there you have everything just as it is. In your practice you should accept everything as it is, giving to each thing the same respect given to a Buddha. Here there is Buddhahood. Then Buddha bows to Buddha, and you bow to yourself. This is the true bow. If you do not have this firm conviction of big mind in your practice, your bow will be dualistic. When you are just yourself, you bow to yourself in its true sense, and you are one with everything. Only when you are you yourself can you bow to everything in its true sense. Bowing is a very serious practice. You should be prepared to bow even in your last moment when you cannot do anything except bow, you should do it. This kind of conviction is necessary. Bow with this spirit and all the precepts, all the teachings are yours, and you will possess everything within your big mind. Sen no Rikyu, the founder of the Japanese tea ceremony, committed hcirakiri ritual suicide by disembowelment in at the order of his lord, Hideyoshi. Just before Rikyu took his own life he said, When I have this sword there is no Buddha and no Patriarchs. He meant that when we have the sword of big mind, there is no dualistic world. The only thing which exists is this spirit. This kind of imperturbable spirit was always present in Rikyu's tea ceremony. He never did anything in just a dualistic way he was ready to die in each moment. In ceremony after ceremony he died, and he renewed himself. This is the spirit of the tea ceremony. This is how we bow. My teacher had a callous on his forehead from bowing. He knew he was an obstinate, stubborn fellow, and so he bowed and bowed and bowed. The reason he bowed was that inside himselfhe always heard his master's scolding voice. He had joined the Soto order when he was thirty, which for a Japanese priest is rather late. When we are young we are less stubborn, and it is easier to get rid of our selfishness. So his master always called my teacher Youlatelyjoinedfellow, and scolded him for joining so late. Actually his master loved him for his stubborn character. When my teacher was seventy, he said, When I was young I was like a tiger, but now I am like a cat! He was very pleased to be like a cat. Bowing helps to eliminate our selfcentered ideas. This is not so easy. It is difficult to get rid of these ideas, and bowing is a very valuable practice. The result is not the point it is the effort to improve ourselves that is valuable. There is no end to this practice. Each bow expresses one of the four Buddhist vows. These vows are: Although sentient beings are innumerable, we vow to save them. Although our evil desires are limitless, we vow to be rid of them. Although the teaching is limitless, we vow to learn it all. Although Buddhism is unattainable, we vow to attain it. If it is unattainable, how can we attain it But we should! That is Buddhism. To think, Because it is possible we will do it, is not Buddhism. Even though it is impossible, we have to do it because our true nature wants us to. But actually, whether or not it is possible is not the point. If it is our inmost desire to get rid of our selfcentered ideas, we have to do it. When we make this effort, our inmost desire is appeased and Nirvana is there. Before you determine to do it, you have difficulty, but once you start to do it, you have none. Your effort appeases your inmost desire. There is no other way to attain calmness. Calmness of mind does not mean you should stop your activity. Real calmness should be found in activity itself. We say, It is easy to have calmness in inactivity, it is hard to have calmness in activity, but calmness in activity is true calmness. After you have practiced for a while, you will realize that it is not possible to make rapid, extraordinary progress. Even though you try very hard, the progress you make is always little by little. It is not like going out in a shower in which you know when you get wet. In a fog, you do not know you are getting wet, but as you keep walking you get wet little by little. If your mind has ideas of progress, you may say, Oh, this pace is terrible! But actually it is not. When you get wet in a fog it is very difficult to dry yourself. So there is no need to worry about progress. It is like studying a foreign language you cannot do it all of a sudden, but by repeating it over and over you will master it. This is the Soto way of practice. We can say either that we make progress little by little, or that we do not even expect to make progress. Just to be sincere and make our full effort in each moment is enough. There is no Nirvana outside our practice. L If you continue this simple practice every day, you will obtain some wonderful power. Before you attain it, it is something wonderful, but after you attain it, it is nothing special. I do not feel like speaking after zazen. I feel the practice of zazen is enough. But if I must say something I think I would like to talk about how wonderful it is to practice zazen. Our purpose is just to keep this practice forever. This practice started from beginningless time, and it will continue into an endless future. Strictly speaking, for a human being there is no other practice than this practice. There is no other way of life than this way of life. Zen practice is the direct expression of our true nature. Of course, whatever we do is the expression of our true nature, but without this practice it is difficult to realize. It is our human nature to be active and the nature of every existence. As long as we are alive, we are always doing something. But as long as you think, I am doing this, or I have to do this, or I must attain something special, you are actually not doing anything. When you give up, when you no longer want something, or when you do not try to do anything special, then you do something. When there is no gaining idea in what you do, then you do something. In zazen what you are doing is not for the sake of anything. You may feel as if you are doing something special, but actually it is only the expression of your true nature it is the activity which appeases your inmost desire. But as long as you think you are practicing zazen for the sake of something, that is not true practice. If you continue this simple practice every day you will obtain a wonderful power. Before you attain it, it is something wonderful, but after you obtain it, it is nothing special. It is just you yourself, nothing special. As a Chinese poem says, I went and I returned. It was nothing special. Rozan famous for its misty mountains Sekko for its water. People think it must be wonderful to see the famous range of mountains covered by mists, and the water said to cover all the earth. But if you go there you will just see water and mountains. Nothing special. It is a kind of mystery that for people who have no experience of enlightenment, enlightenment is something wonderful. But if they attain it, it is nothing. But yet it is not nothing. Do you understand For a mother with children, having L children is nothing special. That is zazen. So, if you continue this practice, more and more you will acquire something nothing special, but nevertheless something. You may say universal nature or Buddhanature or enlightenment. You may call it by many names, but for the person who has it, it is nothing, and it is something. When we express our true nature, we are human beings. When we do not, we do not know what we are. We are not an animal, because we walk on two legs. We are something different from an animal, but what are we We may be a ghost we do not know what to call ourselves. Such a creature does not actually exist. It is a delusion. We are not a human being anymore, but we do exist. When Zen is not Zen, nothing exists. Intellectually my talk makes no sense, but if you have experienced true practice, you will understand what I mean. If something exists, it has its own true nature, its Buddha nature. In the Parinirvana Sutra, Buddha says, Everything has Buddha nature, but Dogen reads it in this way: Everything is Buddhanature. There is a difference. If you say, Everything has Buddha nature, it means Buddha nature is in each existence, so Buddha nature and each existence are different. But when you say, Everything is Buddha nature, it means everything is Buddha nature itself. When there is no Buddhanature, there is nothing at all. Something apart from Buddha nature is just a delusion. It may exist in your mind, but such things actually do not exist. So to be a human being is to be a Buddha. Buddha nature is just another name for human nature, our true human nature. Thus even though you do not do anything, you are actually doing something. You are expressing yourself. You are expressing your true nature. Your eyes will express your voice will express your demeanor will express. The most important thing is to express your true nature in the simplest, most adequate way and to appreciate it in the smallest existence. While you are continuing this practice, week after week, year after year, your experience will become deeper and deeper, and your experience will cover everything you do in your everyday life. The most important thing is to forget all gaining ideas, all dualistic ideas. In other words, just practice zazen in a certain posture. Do not think about anything. Just remain on your cushion without expecting anything. Then eventually you will resume your own true nature. That is to say, your own true nature resumes itself. L The point we emphasize is strong confidence in our original nature. Y Even if the sun k were to rise from the west, the Bodhisattva has only one way. The purpose of my talk is not to give you some intellectual understanding, but just to express my appreciation of our Zen practice. To be able to sit with you in zazen is very, very unusual. Of course, whatever we do is unusual, because our life itself is so unusual. Buddha said, To appreciate your human life is as rare as soil on your fingernail. You know, dirt hardly ever sticks on your nail. Our human life is rare and wonderful when I sit I want to remain sitting forever, but I encourage myself to have another practice, for instance to recite the sutra, or to bow. And when I bow, I think, This is wonderful. But I have to change my practice again to recite the sutra. So the purpose of my talk is to express my appreciation, that is all. Our way is not to sit to acquire something it is to express our true nature. That is our practice. If you want to express yourself, your true nature, there should be some natural and appropriate way of expression. Even swaying right and left as you sit down or get up from zazen is an expression of yourself. It is not preparation for practice, or relaxation after practice it is part of the practice. So we should not do it as if it were preparing for something else. This should be true in your everyday life. To cook, or to fix some food, is not preparation, according to Dogen it is practice. To cook is notjust to prepare food for someone or for yourself it is to express your sincerity. So when you cook you should express yourself in your activity in the kitchen. You should allow yourself plenty of time you should work on it with nothing in your mind, and without expecting anything. You should just cook! That is also an expression of our sincerity, a part of our practice. It is necessary to sit Y in zazen, in this way, but sitting is not our only way. Whatever you do, it should be an expression of the same deep activity. We should appreciate what we are doing. There is no preparation for something else. The Bodhisattva's way is called the singleminded way, or one railway track thousands of miles long. The railway track is always the same. If it were to become wider or narrower, it would be disastrous. Wherever you go, the railway track is always the same. That is the Bodhisattva's way. So even if the sun were to rise from the west, the Bodhisattva has only one way. His way is in each moment to express his nature and his sincerity. We say railway track, but actually there is no such thing. Sincerity itself is the railway track. The sights we see from the train will change, but we are always running on the same track. And there is no beginning or end to the track: beginningless and endless track. There is no starting point nor goal, nothing to attain. Just to run on the track is our way. This is the nature of our Zen practice. But when you become curious about the railway track, danger is there. You should not see the railway track. If you look at the track you will become dizzy. Just appreciate the sights you see from the train. That is our way. There is no need for the passengers to be curious about the track. Someone will take care of it Buddha will take care of it. But sometimes we try to explain the railway track because we become curious if something is always the same. We wonder, How is it possible for the Bodhisattva always to be the same What is his secret But there is no secret. Everyone has the same nature as the railway track. There were two good friends, Chokei and Hofuku. They were talking about the Bodhisattva's way, and Chokei said, Even if the arhat an enlightened one were to have evil desires, still the Tathagata Buddha does not have two kinds of words. I say that the Tathagata has words, but no dualistic words. Hofuku said, Even though you say so, your comment is not perfect. Chokei asked, What is your understanding of the Tathagata's words Hofuku said, We have had enough discussion, so let's have a cup of tea! Hofuku did not give his friend an answer, because it is impossible to give a verbal interpretation of our way. Nevertheless, as a part of their practice these two good friends discussed the Bodhisattva's way, even though they did not expect to find a new interpretation. So Hofuku answered, Our discussion is over. Let's have a cup of tea! That is a very good answer, isn't it It is the same for my talk when my talk is over, your listening is over. There is no need to remember what I say there is no need to understand what I say. You understand you have full understanding within yourself. There is no problem. Ifyou lose the spirit of repeti tiori, jour practice will become quite difficult. The Indian thought and practice encountered by Buddha was based on an idea of human beings as a combination of spiritual and physical elements. They thought that the physical side of man bound the spiritual side, and so their religious practice was aimed at making the physical element weaker in order to free and strengthen the spirit. Thus the practice Buddha found in India emphasized asceticism. But Buddha found when he practiced asceticism that there was no limit to the attempt to purge ourselves physically, and that it made religious practice very idealistic. This kind of war with our body can only end when we die. But according to this Indian thought, we will return in another life, and another life, to repeat the struggle over and over again, without ever attaining perfect enlightenment. And even if you think you can make your physical strength weak enough to free your spiritual power, it will only work as long as you continue your ascetic practice. If you resume your everyday life you will have to strengthen your body, but then you will have to weaken it again to regain your spiritual power. And then you will have to repeat this process over and over again. This may be too great a simplification of the Indian practice encountered by Buddha, and we may laugh at it, but actually some people continue this practice even today. Sometimes without realizing it, this idea of asceticism is in the back of their minds. But practicing in this way will not result in any progress. Buddha's way was quite different. At first he studied the Hindu practice of his time and area, and he practiced asceticism. But Buddha was not interested in the elements comprising human beings, nor in metaphysical theories of existence. He was more concerned about how he himself existed in this moment. That was his point. Bread is made from flour. How flour becomes bread when put in the oven was for Buddha the most important thing. How we become enlightened was his main interest. The enlightened person is some perfect, desirable character, for himself and for others. Buddha wanted to find out how human beings develop this ideal character how various sages in the past became sages. In order to find out how dough became perfect bread, he made it over and over again, until he became quite successful. That was his practice. But we may find it not so interesting to cook the same thing over and over again every day. It is rather tedious, you may say. If you lose the spirit of repetition it will become quite difficult, but it will not be difficult if you are full of strength and vitality. Anyway, we cannot keep still we have to do something. So if you do something, you should be very observant, and careful, and alert. Our way is to put the dough in the oven and watch it carefully. Once you know how the dough becomes bread, you will understand enlightenment. So how this physical body becomes a sage is our main interest. We are not so concerned about what flour is, or what dough is, or what a sage is. A sage is a sage. Metaphysical explanations of human nature are not the point. So the kind of practice we stress thus cannot become too idealistic. If an artist becomes too idealistic, he will commit suicide, because between his ideal and his actual ability there is a great gap. Because there is no bridge long enough to go across the gap, he will begin to despair. That is the usual spiritual way. But our spiritual way is not so idealistic. In some sense we should be idealistic at least we should be interested in making bread which tastes and looks good! Actual practice is repeating over and over again until you find out how to become bread. There is no secret in our way. Just to practice zazen and put ourselves into the oven is our way. Zen is not M J some kind of excitement, but concentration on our usual everyday routine. My master died when I was thirtyone. Although I wanted to devote myself just to Zen practice at Eiheiji monastery, I had to succeed my master at his temple. I became quite busy, and being so young I had many difficulties. These difficulties gave me some experience, but it meant nothing compared with the true, calm, serene way of life. It is necessary for us to keep the constant way. Zen is not some kind of excitement, but concentration on our usual everyday routine. If you become too busy and too excited, your mind becomes rough and ragged. This is not good. If possible, try to be always calm and joyful and keep yourself from excitement. Usually we become busier and busier, day by day, year by year, especially in our modern world. If we revisit old, familiar places after a long time, we are astonished by the changes. It cannot be helped. But if we become interested in some excitement, or in our own change, we will become completely involved in our busy life, and we will be lost. But if your mind is calm and constant, you can keep yourself away from the noisy world even though you are in the midst of it. In the midst of noise and change, your mind will be quiet and stable. Zen is not something to get excited about. Some people start to practice Zen just out of curiosity, and they only make themselves busier. If your practice makes you worse, it is ridiculous. I think that if you try to do zazen once a week, that will make you busy enough. Do not be too interested in Zen. When young people get excited about Zen they often give up schooling and go to some mountain or forest in order to sit. That kind of interest is not true interest. Just continue in your calm, ordinary practice and your character will be built up. If your mind is always busy, there will be no time to build, and you will not be successful, particularly if you work too hard on it. Building character is like making bread you have to mix it little by little, step by step, and moderate temperature is needed. You know yourself quite well, and you know how much temperature you need. You know exactly what you need. But if you get too excited, you will forget how much temperature is good for you, and you will lose your own way. This is very dangerous. Buddha said the same thing about the good ox driver. The driver knows how much load the ox can carry, and he keeps the ox from being overloaded. You know your way and your state of mind. Do not carry too much! Buddha also said that building character is like building a dam. You should be very careful in making the bank. If you try to do it all at once, water will leak from it. Make the bank carefully and you will end up with a fine dam for the reservoir. Our unexciting way of practice may appear to be very negative. This is not so. It is a wise and effective way to work on ourselves. It is just very plain. I find this point very difficult for people, especially young people, to understand. On the other hand it may seem as if I am speaking about gradual attainment. This is not so either. In fact, this is the sudden way, because when your practice is calm and ordinary, everyday life itself is enlightenment. If your practice is good, you may become proud of it. What you do is good, but something more is added to it. Pride is extra. Right effort is to get rid of something extra. The most important point in our practice is to have right or perfect effort. Right effort directed in the right direction is necessary. If your effort is headed in the wrong direction, especially if you are not aware of this, it is deluded effort. Our effort in our practice should be directed from achievement to nonachievement. Usually when you do something, you want to achieve something, you attach to some result. From achievement to nonachievement means to be rid of the unnecessary and bad results of effort. If you do something in the spirit of nonachievement, there is a good quality in it. So just to do something without any particular effort is enough. When you make some special effort to achieve something, some excessive quality, some extra element is involved in it. You should get rid of excessive things. If your practice is good, without being aware of it you will become proud of your practice. That pride is extra. What you do is good, but something more is added to it. So you should get rid of that something which is extra. This point is very, very important, but usually we are not subtle enough to realize it, and we go in the wrong direction. Because all of us are doing the same thing, making the same mistake, we do not realize it. So without realizing it, we are making many mistakes. And we create problems among us. This kind of bad effort is called being Dharmaridden, or practiceridden. You are involved in some idea of practice or attainment, and you cannot get out of it. When you are involved in some dualistic idea, it means your practice is not pure. By purity we do not mean to polish something, trying to make some impure thing pure. By purity we just mean things as they are. When something is added, that is impure. When something becomes dualistic, that is not pure. If you think you will get something from practicing zazen, already you are involved in impure practice. It is all right to say there is practice, and there is enlightenment, but we should not be caught by the statement. You should not be tainted by it. When you practice zazen, just practice zazen. If enlightenment comes, it just comes. We should not attach to the attainment. The true quality of zazen is always there, even if you are not aware of it, so forget all about what you think you may have gained from it. Just do it. The quality of zazen will express itself then you will have it. People ask what it means to practice zazen with no gaining idea, what kind of effort is necessary for that kind of practice. The answer is: effort to get rid of something extra from our practice. If some extra idea comes, you should try to stop it you should remain in pure practice. That is the point towards which our effort is directed. We say, To hear the sound of one hand clapping. Usually the sound of clapping is made with two hands, and we think that clapping with one hand makes no sound at all. But actually, one hand is sound. Even though you do not hear it, there is sound. If you clap with two hands, you can hear the sound. But if sound did not already exist before you clapped, you could not make the sound. Before you make it there is sound. Because there is sound, you can make it, and you can hear it. Sound is everywhere. If you just practice it, there is sound. Do not try to listen to it. If you do not listen to it, the sound is all over. Because you try to hear it, sometimes there is sound, and sometimes there is no sound. Do you understand Even though you do not do anything, you have the quality of zazen always. But if you try to find it, if you try to see the quality, you have no quality. You are living in this world as one individual, but before you take the form of a human being, you are already there, always there. We are always here. Do you understand You think before you were born you were not here. But how is it possible for you to appear in this world, when there is no you Because you are already there, you can appear in the world. Also, it is not possible for something to vanish which does not exist. Because something is there, something can vanish. You may think that when you die, you disappear, you no longer exist. But even though you vanish, something which is existent cannot be nonexistent. That is the magic. We ourselves cannot put any magic spells on this world. The world is its own magic. If we are looking at something, it can vanish from our sight, but if we do not try to see it, that something cannot vanish. Because you are watching it, it can disappear, but if no one is watching, how is it possible for anything to disappear If someone is watching you, you can escape from him, but if no one is watching, you cannot escape from yourself. So try not to see something in particular try not to achieve anything special. You already have everything in your own pure quality. If you understand this ultimate fact, there is no fear. There may be some difficulty, of course, but there is no fear. If people have difficulty without being aware of the difficulty, that is true difficulty. They may appear very confident, they may think they are making a big effort in the right direction, but without knowing it, what they do comes out of fear. Something may vanish for them. But if your effort is in the right direction, then there is no fear of losing anything. Even if it is in the wrong direction, if you are aware of that, you will not be deluded. There is nothing to lose. There is only the constant pure quality of right practice. When you do something, you should burn yourself completely, like a good bonfire, leaving no trace of yourself . When we practice zazen our mind is calm and quite simple. But usually our mind is very busy and complicated, and it is difficult to be concentrated on what we are doing. This is because before we act we think, and this thinking leaves some trace. Our activity is shadowed by some preconceived idea. The thinking not only leaves some trace or shadow, but also gives us many other notions about other activities and things. These traces and notions make our minds very complicated. When we do something with a quite simple, clear mind, we have no notion or shadows, and our activity is strong and straightforward. But when we do something with a complicated mind, in relation to other things or people, or society, our activity becomes very complex. Most people have a double or triple notion in one activity. There is a saying, To catch two birds with one stone. That is what people usually try to do. Because they want to catch too many birds they find it difficult to be concentrated on one activity, and they may end up not catching any birds at all! That kind of thinking always leaves its shadow on their activity. The shadow is not actually the thinking itself. Of course it is often necessary to think or prepare before we act. But right thinking does not leave any shadow. Thinking which leaves traces comes out of your relative confused mind. Relative mind is the mind which sets itself in relation to other things, thus limiting itself. It is this small mind which creates gaining ideas and leaves traces of itself. If you leave a trace of your thinking on your activity, you will be attached to the trace. For instance, you may say, This is what I have done ! But actually it is not so. In your recollection you may say, I did such and such a thing in some certain way, but actually that is never exactly what happened. When you think in this way you limit the actual experience of what you have done. So if you attach to the idea of what you have done, you are involved in selfish ideas. Often we think what we have done is good, but it may not actually be so. When we become old, we are often very proud of what we have done. When others listen to someone proudly telling something which he has done, they will feel funny, because they know his recollection is onesided. They know that what he has told them is not exactly what he did. Moreover, if he is proud of what he did, that pride will create some problem for him. Repeating his recollections in this way, his personality will be twisted more and more, until he becomes quite a disagreeable, stubborn fellow. This is an example ofleaving a trace ofone's thinking. We should not forget what we did, but it should be without an extra trace. To leave a trace is not the same as to remember something. It is necessary to remember what we have done, but we should not become attached to what we have done in some special sense. What we call attachment is just these traces of our thought and activity. In order not to leave any traces, when you do something, you should do it with your whole body and mind you should be concentrated on what you do. You should do it completely, like a good bonfire. You should not be a smoky fire. You should burn yourself completely. If you do not burn yourself completely, a trace of yourself will be left in what you do. You will have something remaining which is not completely burned out. Zen activity is activity which is completely burned out, with nothing remaining but ashes. This is the goal of our practice. That is what Dogen meant when he said, Ashes do not come back to firewood. Ash is ash. Ash should be completely ash. The firewood should be firewood. When this kind of activity takes place, one activity covers everything. So our practice is not a matter of one hour or two hours, or one day or one year. If you practice zazen with your whole body and mind, even for a moment, that is zazen. So moment after moment you should devote yourself to your practice. You should not have any remains after you do something. But this does not mean to forget all about it. If you understand this point, all the dualistic thinking and all the problems of life will vanish. When you practice Zen you become one with Zen. There is no you and no zazen. When you bow, there is no Buddha and no you. One complete bowing takes place, that is all. This is Nirvana. When Buddha transmitted our practice to Maha Kashyapa, he just picked up a flower with a smile. Only Maha Kashyapa understood vhat he meant no one else understood. We do not know if this is a historical event or not, but it means something. It is a demonstration of our traditional way. Some activity which covers everything is true activity, and the secret of this activity is transmitted from Buddha to us. This is Zen practice, not some teaching taught by Buddha, or some rules of life set up by him. The teaching or the rules should be changed according to the place, or according to the people who observe them, but the secret of this practice cannot be changed. It is always true. So for us there is no other way to live in this world. I think this is quite true and this is easy to accept, easy to understand, and easy to practice. If you compare the kind of life based on this practice with what is happening in this world, or in human society, you will find out just how valuable the truth Buddha left us is. It is quite simple, and practice is quite simple. But even so, we should not ignore it its great value must be discovered. Usually when it is so simple we say, Oh, I know that! It is quite simple. Everyone knows that. But if we do not find its value, it means nothing. It is the same as not knowing. The more you understand culture, the more you will understand how true and how necessary this teaching is. Instead of only criticizing your culture, you should devote your mind and body to practicing this simple way. Then society and culture will grow out of you. It may be all right for the people who are too attached to their culture to be critical. Their critical attitude means they are coming back to the simple truth left by Buddha. But our approach is just to be concentrated on a simple basic practice and a simple basic xmderstanding of life. There should be no traces in our activity. We should not attach to some fancy ideas or to some beautiful things. We should not seek for something good. The truth is always near at hand, within your reach. 'To give is nonattachment,' that is just not to attach to anything is to give. Every existence in nature, every existence in the human world, every cultural work that we create, is something which was given, or is being given to us, relatively speaking. But as everything is originally one, we are, in actuality, giving out everything. Moment after moment we are creating something, and this is the joy of our life. But this which is creating and always giving out something is not the small I it is the big . Even though you do not realize the oneness of this big I with everything, when you give something you feel good, because at that time you feel at one with what you are giving. This is why it feels better to give than to take. We have a saying, Dana prajna paramita. Dana means to give, prajna is wisdom, and paramita means to cross over, or to reach the other shore. Our life can be seen as a crossing of a river. The goal of our life's effort is to reach the other shore. Nirvana. Prajna paramita, the true wisdom of life, is that in each step of the way, the other shore is actually reached. To reach the other shore with each step of the crossing is the way of true living. Dana prajna paramita is the first of the six ways of true living. The second is sila prajna paramita, or the Buddhist precepts. Then there are kshanti prajna paramita, or endurance 'virya prajna paramita, or ardor and constant efifort dhyana prajna paramita, or Zen practice and prajna paramita, or wisdom. Actually these six prajna paramita are one, but as we can observe life from various sides, we count six. Dogenzenji said, To give is nonattachment, That is, just not to attach to anything is to give. It does not matter what is given. To give a penny or a piece of leaf is dana prajna paramita to give one line, or even one word of teaching is dana prajna paramita. If given in the spirit of nonattachment, the material offering and the teaching offering have the same value. With the right spirit, all that we do, all that we create is dana prajna paramita. So Dogen said, To produce something, to participate in human activity is also dana prajna paramita.' To provide a ferryboat for people, or to make a bridge for people is 'dana prajna paramita.' Actually, to give one line of the teaching may be to make a ferryboat for someone ! According to Christianity, every existence in nature is something which was created for or given to us by God. That is the perfect idea of giving. But if you think that God created man, and that you are somehow separate from God, you are liable to think you have the ability to create something separate, something not given by Him, For instance, we create airplanes and highways. And when we repeat, I create, I create, I create, soon we forget who is actually the I which creates the various things we soon forget about God. This is the danger of human culture. Actually, to create with the big I is to give we cannot create and ovni what we create for ourselves since everything was created by God, This point should not be forgotten. But because we do forget who is doing the creating and the reason for the creation, we become attached to the material or exchange value. This has no value in comparison to the absolute value of something as God's creation. Even though something has no material or relative value to any small , it has absolute value in itself. Not to be attached to something is to be aware of its absolute value. Everything you do should be based on such an awareness, and not on material or selfcentered ideas of value. Then whatever you do is true giving, is dana prajna paramita. When we sit in the crosslegged posture, we resume our fundamental activity of creation. There are perhaps three kinds of creation. The first is to be aware of ourselves after we finish zazen. When we sit we are nothing, we do not even realize what we are wejust sit. But when we stand up, we are there! That is the first step in creation. When you are there, everything else is there everything is created all at once. When we emerge from nothing, when everything emerges from nothing, we see it all as a fresh new creation. This is nonattachment. The second kind of creation is when you act, or produce or prepare something like food or tea. The third kind is to create something within yourself, such as education, or culture, or art, or some system for our society. So there are three kinds of creation. But if you forget the first, the most important one, the other two will be like children who have lost their parents their creation will mean nothing. Usually everyone forgets about zazen. Everyone forgets about God. They work very hard at the second and third kinds of creation, but God does not help the activity. How is it possible for Him to help when He does not realize who He is That is why we have so many problems in this world. When we forget the fundamental source of our creating, we are like children who do not know what to do when they lose their parents. If you understand dana prajna paramita, you will understand how it is we create so many problems for ourselves. Of course, to live is to create problems. If we did not appear in this world, our parents would have no difficulty with us ! Just by appearing we create problems for them. This is all right. Everything creates some problems. But usually people think that when they die, everything is over, the problems disappear. But your death may create problems too! Actually, our problems should be solved or dissolved in this gg life. But if we are aware that what we do or what we create is really the gift of the big , then we will not be attached to it, and we will not create problems for ourselves or for others. And we should forget, day by day, what we have done this is true nonattachment. And we should do something new. To do something new, of course we must know our past, and this is all right. But we should not keep holding onto anything we have done we should only reflect on it. And we must have some idea of what we should do in the future. But the future is the future, the past is the past now we should work on something new. This is our attitude, and how we should live in this world. This is dana prajna paramita, to give something, or to create something for ourselves. So to do something through and through is to resume our true activity of creation. This is why we sit. If we do not forget this point, everything will be carried on beautifully. But once we forget this point, the world will be filled with confusion. M istakes in practice it is when your practice is rather greedy that jou become discouraged with it. So you should he grateful thatjou have a sign or warning signal to show jou the weak point in jour practice. There are several poor ways of practice which you should understand. Usually when you practice zazen, you become very idealistic, and you set up an ideal or goal which you strive to attain and fulfill. But as I have often said, this is absurd. When you are idealistic, you have some gaining idea within yourself by the time you attain your ideal or goal, your gaining idea will create another ideal. So as long as your practice is based on a gaining idea, and you practice zazen in an idealistic way, you will have no time actually to attain your ideal. Moreover, you will be sacrificing the meat of your practice. Because your attainment is always ahead, you will always be sacrificing yourself now for some ideal in the future. You end up with nothing. This is absurd it is not adequate practice at all. But even worse than this idealistic attitude is to practice zazen in competition with someone else. This is a poor, shabby kind of practice. Our Soto way puts an emphasis on shikan taza, or just sitting. Actually we do not have any particular name for our practice when we practice zazen we just practice it, and whether we find joy in our practice or not, we just do it. Even though we are sleepy, and we are tired of practicing zazen, of repeating the same thing day after day even so, we continue our practice. Whether or not someone encourages our practice, we just do it. Even when you practice zazen alone, without a teacher, I think you veill find some way to tell whether your practice is adequate or not. When you are tired of sitting, or when you are disgusted with your practice, you should recognize this as a warning signal. You become discouraged with your practice when your practice has been idealistic. You have some gaining idea in your practice, and it is not pure enough. It is when your practice is rather greedy that you become discouraged with it. So you should be grateful that you have a sign or warning signal to show you the weak point in your practice. At that time, forgetting all about your mistake and renewing your way, you can resume your original practice. This is a very important point. So as long as you continue yourpractice, you are quite safe, but as it is very difficult to continue, you must find some way to encourage yourself. As it is hard to encourage yourself without becoming involved in some poor kind of practice, to continue our pure practice by yourself may be rather difficult. This is why we have a teacher. With your teacher you will correct your practice. Of course you will have a very hard time with him, but even so, you will always be safe from wrong practice. Most Zen Buddhist priests have had a difficult time with their masters. When they talk about the difficulties, you may think that without this kind of hardship you cannot practice zazen. But this is not true. Whether you have difficulties in your practice or not, as long as you continue it, you have pure practice in its true sense. Even when you are not aware of it, you have it. So Dogenzenji said, Do not think you will necessarily be aware of your own enlightenment. Whether or not you are aware of it, you have your own true enlightenment within your practice. Another mistake will be to practice for the sake of the joy you find in it. Actually, when your practice is involved in a feeling of joy, it is not in very good shape either. Of course this is not poor practice, but compared to the true practice it is not so good. In Hinayana Buddhism,, practice is classified in four ways. The best way is just to do it without having any joy in it, not even spiritual joy. This way is just to do it, forgetting your physical and mental feeling, forgetting all about yourself in your practice. This is the fourth stage, or the highest stage. The next highest stage is to have just physical Joy in your practice. At this stage you find some pleasure in practice, and you will practice because of the pleasure you find in it. In the second stage you have both mental and physical joy, or good feeling. These two middle stages are stages in which you practice zazen because you feel good in vour practice. The first stage is when you have no thinking and no curiosity in your practice. These four stages also apply to our Mahayana practice, and the highest is just to practice it. If you find some difficulty in your practice, that is the warning that you have somie wrong idea, so you have to be careful. But do not give up your practice continue it, knowing your weakness. Here there is no gaining idea. Here there is no fixed idea of attainment. You do not say, This is enlightenment, or Thatisnotrightpractice. Evenin wrong practice, when you realize it and continue, there is right practice. Our practice cannot be perfect, but without being discouraged by this, we should continue it. This is the secret of practice. I And if you want to find some encouragement in your discouragement, getting tired of practice is itself the encouragement. You encourage yourself when you get tired of it. When you do not want to do it, that is the warning signal. It is like having a toothache when your teeth are not so good. When you feel some pain in your teeth, you go to the dentist. That is our way. The cause of conflict is some fixed idea or onesided idea. When everyone knows the value of pure practice, we will have little conflict in our world. This is the secret of our practice and Dogenzenji's way. Dogen repeats this point in his book Shobogenzo A Treasury of the True Dharma. If you understand the cause of conflict as some fixed or onesided idea, you can find meaning in various practices without being caught by any of them. If you do not realize this point you will be easily caught by some particular way, and you will say, This is enlightenment! This is perfect practice. This is our way. The rest of the ways are not perfect. This is the best way. This is a big mistake. There is no particular way in true practice. You should find your own way, and you should know what kind of practice you have right now. Knowing both the advantages and disadvantages of some special practice, you can practice that special way without danger. But if you have a onesided attitude, you will ignore the disadvantage of the practice, emphasizing only its good part. Eventually you will discover the worst side of the practice, and become discouraged when it is too late. This is silly. We should be grateful that the ancient teachers point out this mistake. L imiting your activity Usually when someone believes in a particular religion, his attitude becomes more and more a sharp angle pointing away from himself. In our way the point of the angle is always towards ourselves. In our practice we have no particular purpose or goal, nor any special object of worship. In this respect our practice is somewhat different from the usual religious practices. Joshu, a great Chinese Zen master, said, A clay Buddha cannot cross water a bronze Buddha cannot get through a furnace a wooden Buddha cannot get through fire. Whatever it is, if your practice is directed toward some particular object, such as a clay, a bronze, or a wooden Buddha, it will not always work. So as long as you have some particular goal in your practice, that practice will not help you completely. It may help as long as you are directed towards that goal, but when you resume your everyday life, it will not work. You may think that if there is no purpose or no goal in our practice, we will not know what to do. But there is a way. The way to practice without having any goal is to limit your activity, or to be concentrated on what you are doing in this moment. Instead of having some particular object in mind, you should limit your activity. When your mind is wandering about elsewhere you have no chance to express yourself. But if you limit your activity to what you can do just now, in this moment, then you can express fully your true nature, which is the universal Buddha nature. This is our way. When we practice zazen we limit our activity to the smallest extent. Just keeping the right posture and being concentrated on sitting is how we express the tmiversal nature. Then we become Buddha, and we express Buddha nature. So instead of having some object of worship, we just concentrate on the activity which we do in each moment. When you bow, you shouldjust bow when you sit, you should just sit when you eat, you should iust eat. If you do this, the universal na Y ture is there. In Japanese we call it ichigjozammai, or oneact samadhi. Sammai or samadhi is concentration. Ichigyo is one practice. I think some of you who practice zazen here may beheve in some other religion, but I do not mind. Our practice has nothing to do with some particular religious belief. And for you, there is no need to hesitate to practice our way, because it has nothing to do with Christianity or Shintoism or Hinduism. Ourpractice is for everyone. Usually when somieone believes in a particular religion, his attitude becomes more and more a sharp angle pointing away from himself. But our way is not like this. In our way the point of the sharp angle is always towards ourselves, not away from ourselves. So there is no need to worry about the difference between Buddhism and the religion you may believe in. Joshu's statement about the different Buddhas concerns those who direct their practice towards some particular Buddha. One kind of Buddha will not serve your purpose completely. You will have to throw it away sometime, or at least ignore it. But if you understand the secret of our practice, wherever you go, you yourself are boss. No matter what the situation, you cannot neglect Buddha, because you yourself are Buddha. Only this Buddha will help you completely. Y F To have some deep Jeeling about Buddhism is not the point we just do what we should do, like eating supper and going to bed. This is Buddhism. The purpose of studying Buddhism is not to study Buddhism, but to study ourselves. It is impossible to study ourselves without some teaching. If you want to know what water is you need science, and the scientist needs a laboratory. In the laboratory there are various ways in which to study what water is. Thus it is possible to know what kind of elements water has, the various forms it takes, and its nature. But it is impossible thereby to know water in itself. It is the same thing with us. We need some teaching, but just by studying the teaching alone, it is impossible to know what I in myself am. Through the teaching we may understand our human nature. But the teaching is not we ourselves it is some explanation of ourselves. So if you are attached to the teaching, or to the teacher, that is a big mistake. The moment you meet a teacher, you should leave the teacher, and you should be independent. You need a teacher so that you can become independent. If you are not attached to him, the teacher will show you the way to yourself. You have a teacher for yourself, not for the teacher. Rinzai, an early Chinese Zen master, analyzed how to teach his disciples in four ways. Sometimes he talked about the disciple himself sometimes he talked about the teaching itself sometimes he gave an interpretation of the disciple or the teaching and finally, sometimes he did not give any instruction at all to his disciples. He knew that even without being given any instruction, a student is a student. Strictly speaking, there is no need to teacK the student, because the student himself is Buddha, even though he may not be aware of it. And even though he is aware of his true nature, if he is attached to this awareness, that is already wrong. When he is not aware of it, he has everything, but when he becomes aware of it he thinks that what he is aware of is himself, which is a big mistake. When you do not hear anything from the teacher, but just sit, this is called teaching without teaching. But sometimes this is not sufficient, so we listen to lectures and have discussions. But we should remember that the purpose of practice in a particular place is to study ourselves. To be independent, we study. Like the scientist, we have to have some means by which to study. We need a teacher because it is impossible to study ourselves by ourselves. But you should not make a mistake. You should not take what you have learned with a teacher for you yourself. The study you make with your teacher is a part of your everyday life, a part of your incessant Y F activity. In this sense there is no difference between the practice and the activity you have in everyday life. So to find the meaning of your life in the zendo is to find the meaning of your everyday activity. To be aware of the meaning of your life, you practice zazen. When I was at Eiheiji monastery in Japan, everyone was just doing what he should do. That is all. It is the same as waking up in the morning we have to get up. At Eiheiji monastery, when we had to sit, we sat when we had to bow to Buddha, we bowed to Buddha. That is all. And when we were practicing, we did not feel anything special. We did not even feel that we were leading a monastic life. For us, the monastic life was the usual life, and the people who came from the city were unusual people. When we saw them we felt, Oh, some unusual people have come! But once I had left Eiheiji and been away for some time, coming back was different. I heard the various sounds of practice the bells and the monks reciting the sutra and I had a deep feeling. There were tears flowing out of my eyes, nose, and mouth! It is the people who are outside of the monastery who feel its atmosphere. Those who are practicing actually do not feel anything. I think this is true for everything. When we hear the sound of the pine trees on a windy day, perhaps the wind is just blowing, and the pine tree is just standing in the wind. That is all that they are doing. But the people who listen to the wind in the tree will write a poem, or will feel something unusual. That is, I think, the way everything is. So to feel something about Buddhism is not the main point. Whether that feeling is good or bad is out of the question. We do not mind, whatever it is. Buddhism is not good or bad. We are doing w A hat we should do. That is Buddhism. Of course some encouragement is necessary, but that encouragement is just encouragement. It is not the true purpose of practice. Itisjustmedicine. When we become discouraged we want some medicine. When we are in good spirits we do not need any medicine. You should not mistake medicine for food. Sometimes medicine is necessary, but it should not become our food. So, of Rinzai's four ways of practice, the perfect one is not to give a student any interpretation of himself, nor to give him any encouragement. If we think of ourselves as our bodies, the teaching then may be our clothing. Sometimes we talk about our clothing sometimes we talk about our body. But neither body nor clothing is actually we ourselves. We ourselves are the big activity. We are just expressing the smallest particle of the big activity, that is all. So it is all right to talk about ourselves, but actually there is no need to do so. Before we open our mouths, we are already expressing the big existence, including ourselves. So the purpose of talking about ourselves is to correct the misunderstanding we have when we are attached to any particular temporal form or color of the big activity. It is necessary to talk about what our body is and what our activity is so that we may not make any mistake about them. So to talk about ourselves is actually to forget about ourselves. Dogenzenji said, To study Buddhism is to study ourselves. To study ourselves is to forget ourselves. When you become attached to a temporal expression of your true nature, it is necessary to talk about Buddhism, or else you will think the temporal expression is it. But this particular expression of it is not it. And yet at the same time it is it! For a while this is it for the smallest particle of time, this is it. But it is not always so: the very next instant it is not so, thus this is not it. So that you will realize this fact, it is necessary to study Buddhism. But the purpose of studying Buddhism is to study ourselves and to forget ourselves. When we forget ourselves, wA actually are the true activity of the big existence, or reality itself. When we realize this fact, there is no problem whatsoever in this world, and we can enjoy our life without feeling any difficulties. The purpose of our practice is to be aware of this fact. Y F H A When you become you, Zen becomes Zen. When you are you, you see things as they are, and you become one with your surroundings. Zen stories, or hoans, are very difficult to understand before you know what we are doing moment after moment. But if you know exactly what we are doing in each moment, you will not find koans so difficult. There are so many koans. I have often talked to you about a frog, and each time everybody laughs. But a frog is very interesting. He sits like us, too, you know. But he does not think that he is doing anything so special. When you go to a zendo and sit, you may think you are doing some special thing. While your husband or wife is sleeping, you are practicing zazen! You are doing some special thing, and your spouse is lazy! That may be your understanding of zazen. But look at the frog. A frog also sits like us, but he has no idea of zazen. Watch him. If something annoys him, he will make a face. If something comes along to eat, he will snap it up and eat, and he eats sitting. Actually that is our zazen not any special thing. Here is a kind of frog koan for you. Baso was a famous Zen master called the Horsemaster. He was the disciple of Nangaku, one of the Sixth Patriarch's disciples. One day while he was studying under Nangaku, Baso was sitting, practicing zazen. He was a man of large physical build when he talked, his tongue reached to his nose his voice was loud and his zazen must have been very good. Nangaku saw him sitting like a great mountain or like a frog. Nangaku asked, What are you doing 'Tampracticingzazen, Baso replied. Why are you practicing zazen I want to attain enlightenment I want to be a Buddha, the disciple said. Do you know what the teacher did He picked up a tile, and he started to polish it. In Japan, after taking a tile from the kiln, we polish it to give it a beautiful finish. So Nangaku picked up a tile and started to polish it. Baso, his disciple, asked, What are you doing I want to make this tile into a jewel, Nangaku said. How is it possible to make a tile a jewel Baso asked. How is it possible to become a Buddha by practicing zazen Nangaku replied. Do you want to attain Buddhahood There is no Buddhahood besides your ordinary mind. When a cart does not go, which do you whip, the cart or the horse the master asked. Nangaku's meaning here is that whatever you do, that is zazen. True zazen is beyond being in bed or sitting in the zendo. If your husband or wife is in bed, that is zazen. If you think, I am sitting here, and my spouse is in bed, then even though you are sitting here in the crosslegged position, that is not true zazen. You should be like a frog always. That is true zazen. Dogenzenji commented on this koan. He said. When the Horsemaster becomes the Horsemaster, Zen becomes Zen. When Baso becomes Baso, his zazen becomes true zazen, and Zen becomes Zen. What is true zazen When you become you! When you are you, then no matter what you do, that is zazen. Even though you are in bed, you may not be you most of the time. Even though you are sitting in the zendo, I wonder whether you are you in the true sense. Here is another famous koan. Zuikan was a Zen master who always used to address himself. Zuikan he would call. And then he would answer. Yes! Zuikan Yes! Of course he was living all alone in his small zendo, and of course he knew who he was, but sometimes he lost himself. And whenever he lost himself, he would address himself, Zuikan Yes! If we are like a frog, we are always ourselves. But even a frog sometimes loses himself, and he makes a sour face. And if something comes along, he will snap at it and eat it. So I think a frog is always addressing himself. I think you should do that also. Even in zazen you will lose yourself. When you become sleepy, or when your mind starts to wander about, you lose yourself. When your legs become painful 'Why are my legs so painful you lose yourself. Because you H A g lose yourself, your problem will be a problem for you. If you do not lose yourself, then even though you have difficulty, there is actually no problem whatsoever. You just sit in the midst of the problem when you are a part of the problem, or when the problem is a part of you, there is no problem, because you are the problem itself. The problem is you yourself. If this is so, there is no problem. When your life is always a part of your surroundings in other words, when you are called back to yourself, in the present moment then there is no problem. When you start to wander about in some delusion which is something apart from you yourself, then your surroundings are not real anymore, and your mind is not real anymore. If you yourself are deluded, then your surroundings are also a misty, foggy delusion. Once you are in the midst of delusion, there is no end to delusion. You will be involved in deluded ideas one after another. Most people live in delusion, involved in their problem, trying to solve their problem. But just to live is actually to live in problems. And to solve the problem is to be a part of it, to be one with it. So which do you hit, the cart or the horse Which do you hit, yourself or your problems If you start questioning which you should hit, that means you have already started to wander about. But when you actually hit the horse, the cart will go. In truth, the cart and the horse are not different. When you are you, there is no problem of whether you should hit the cart or the horse. When you are you, zazen becomes true zazen. So when you practice zazen, your problem will practice zazen, and everything else will practice zazen too. Even though your spouse is in bed, he or she is also practicing zazen when jou practice zazen ! But when you do not practice true zazen, then there is your spouse, and there is yourself, each quite different, quite separate from the other. So if you yourself have true practice, then everything else is practicing our way at the same time. That is why we should always address ourselves, checking up on ourselves like a doctor tapping himself. This is very important. This kind of practice should be continued moment after moment, incessantly. We say, When the night is here, the dawn comes. It means there is no gap between the dawn and the night. Before the summer is over, autumn comes. In this way we should understand our life. We should practice with this understanding, and solve our problems in this way. Actually, just to work on the problem, if you do it with singleminded effort, is enough. You should just polish the tile that is our practice. The puipose of practice is not to make a tile ajewel. Just continue sitting that is practice in its true sense. It is not a matter of whether or not it is possible to attain Buddhahood, whether or not it is possible to make a tile ajewel. Just to work and live in this world with this understanding is the most important point. That is our practice. That is true zazen. So we say, When you eat, eat! You should eat what is there, you know. Sometimes you do not eat it. Even though you are eating, your mind is somewhere else. You do not taste what you have in your mouth. As long as you can eat when you are eating, you are all right. Do not worry a bit. It means you are you yourself. When you are you, you see things as they are, and you become one with your surroundings. There is your true self. There you have true practice you have the practice of a frog. He is a good example of our practice when a frog becomes a frog, Zen becomes Zen. When you imderstand a frog through and through, you attain enlightenment you are Buddha. And you are good for others, too: husband or wife or son or daughter. This is zazen! C Y People who know the state of emptiness will always be able to dissolve their problems by constancy. The message for us today is Cultivate your own spirit. It means not to go seeking for something outside of yourself. This is a very important point, and it is the only way to prac Y tice Zen. Of course, studying scriptures or reciting the sutra or sitting is Zen each of these activities should be Zen. But if your effort or practice does not have the right orientation, it will not work at all. Not only will it not work, but it may spoil your pure nature. Then the more you know A about Zen, the more you will become spoiled. Your mind will be filled with rubbish your mind will be stained. It is quite usual for us to gather pieces of information from various sources, thinking in this way to increase our knowledge. Actually, following this way we end up not knowing anything at all. Our understanding of Buddhism should not be just gathering many pieces of information, seeking to gain knowledge. Instead of gathering knowledge, you should clear your mind. If your mind is clear, true knowledge is already yours. When you listen to our teaching with a pure, clear mind, you can accept it as if you were hearing something which you already knew. This is called emptiness, or omnipotent self, or knowing everything. When you know everything, you are like a dark sky. Sometimes a flashing will come through the dark sky. After it passes, you forget all about it, and there is nothing left but the dark sky. The sky is never surprised when all of a sudden a thunderbolt breaks through. And when the lightning does flash, a wonderful sight may be seen. When we have emptiness we are always prepared for watching the flashing. In China, Rozan is famous for its misty scenery. I have not been to China yet, but there must be beautiful mountains there. And to see the white clouds or mist come and go through the mountains must be a very wonderful sight. Although it is wonderful, a Chinese poem says, Rozan is famous for its misty, rainy days, and the great river Sekko for its tide, coming and going. That is all. That is all, but it is splendid. This is how we appreciate things. So you should accept knowledge as if you were hearing something you already knew. But this does not mean to receive various pieces of information merely as an echo of your own opinions. It means that you should not be surprised at whatever you see or hear. If you receive things just as an echo of yourself, you do not really see them, you do not fully accept them as they are. So when we say, Rozan is famous for its misty, rainy days, it does not mean to appreciate this sight by recollecting some scenery we have seen before: It is not so wonderful. I have seen that sight before. Or 'Thave painted much more beautiful paintings ! Rozan is nothing! This is not our way. If you are ready to accept things as they are, you will receive them as old friends, even though you appreciate them mth new feeling. And we should not hoard knowledge we should be free from our knowledge. If you collect various pieces of knowledge, as a collection it may be very good, but this is not our way. We should not try to surprise people by our wonderful treasures. We should not be interested in something special. If you want to appreciate something fully, you should forget yourself. You should accept it like lightning flashing in the utter darkness of the sky. Sometimes we think it is impossible for us to understand something unfamiliar, but actually there is nothing that is imfamiliar to us. Some people may say, It is almost impossible to understand Buddhism because our cultural background is so different. How can we understand Oriental thought Of course Buddhisni cannot be separated from its cultural background this is true. But if a Japanese Buddhist comes to the United States, he is no longer a Japanese, i am living in your cultural background. I am eating nearly the same food as you eat, and I am communicating with you in your language. Even though you do not understand me completely, I want to understand you. And I may understand you better than anyone who can speak and understand English. This is true. Even if I could not understand English at all, I think I could communicate with people. There is always a possibility of understanding as long as we exist in the utter darkness ofthe sky, as long as we live in emptiness. I have always said that you must be very patient if you want to understand Buddhism, but I have been seeking for a better Y word than patience. The usual translation of the Japanese word nin is patience, but perhaps constancy is a better word. You must force yourself to be patient, but in constancy there is no particular effort involved there is only the unchanging ability to accept things as they are. For people who have no idea of emptiness, this ability may appear to be patience, but patience can actually be nonacceptance. People who know, even if only intuitively, the state of emptiness always have open the possibility of accepting things as they are. They can appreciate everything. In everything they do, even though it may be very difficult, they will always be able to dissolve their problems by constancy. Nin is the way we cultivate our own spirit. Nin is our way of continuous practice. We should always live in the dark empty sky. The sky is always the sky. Even though clouds and lightning come, the sky is not disturbed. Even if the flashing of enlightenment comes, our practice forgets all about it. Then it is ready for another enlightenment. It is necessary for us to have enlightenments one after another, if possible, moment after moment. This is what is called enlightenment before you attain it and after you attain it. C Without any intentional, fancy way of adjusting yourself to express yourself as you are is the most important thing. Communication is very important in Zen practice. Because I cannot speak your language very well, I am always seeking some way of communicating with you. I think that this kind of effort will result in something very good. We say that if you do not understand your master's words, you are not his disciple. To understand your master's words, or your master's language, is to understand your master himself. And when you understand him, you find his language is not just ordinary language, but language in its wider sense. Through your master's language, you understand more than what his words actually say. When we say something, our subjective intention or situation is always involved. So there is no perfect word some distortion is always present in a statement. But nevertheless, through our master's statement we have to understand objective fact itself the ultimate fact. By ultimate fact we do not mean something eternal or something constant, we mean things as they are in each moment. You may call it being or reality. To understand reality as a direct experience is the reason we practice zazen, and the reason we study Buddhism. Through the study of Buddhism, you will understand your human nature, your intellectual faculty, and the truth present in your human activity. And you can take this human nature of yours into consideration when you seek to understand reality. But only by the actual practice ofZen can you experience reality directly and understand in their true sense the various statements made by your teacher or by Buddha. In a strict sense, it is not possible to speak about reality. Nevertheless, if you are a Zen student, you have to understand it directly through your master's words. Your master's direct statement may not be only in words his behavior is likewise his way of expressing himself. In Zen we put emphasis on demeanor, or behavior. By behavior w do not mean a particular way that you ought to behave, but rather the natural expression of yourself. We emphasize straightforwardness. You should be true to your feelings, and to your mind, expressing yourself without any reservations. This helps the listener to understand more easily. When you listen to someone, you should give up all your preconceived ideas and your subjective opinions you should just listen to him, just observe what his way is. We put very little emphasis on right and wrong or good and bad. We just see things as they are with him, and accept them. This ishow we communicate with each other. Usually when you listen to some statement, you hear it as a kind of echo of yourself. You are actually listening to your own opinion. If it agrees with your opinion you may accept it, but if it does not, you will reject it or you may not even really hear it. That is one danger when you listen to someone. The other danger is to be caught by the statement. If you do not understand your master's statement in its true sense, you will easily be caught by something which is involved in your subjective opinion, or by some particular way the statement is expressed. You will take what he says only as a statement, vdthout understanding the spirit behind the words. This kind of danger is always there. It is difficult to have good communication between parents and children because parents always have their own intentions. Their intentions are nearly always good, but the way they speak, or the way they express themselves, is often not so free it is usually too onesided and not realistic. We each have our own way of expressing ourselves, and it is difficult to change that way according to the circumstances. If parents can manage to express themselves in various ways according to each situation, there will be no danger in the education of their children. This, however, is rather difficult. Even a Zen master has his own way. When Nishiarizenji scolded his disciples, he always said, Go away! One of his students took him literally and left the temple ! But the master did not mean to expel the student. It was just his way of expressing himself. Instead of saying, Be careful! he said, Go away! If your parents have this kind of habit, you will easily misunderstand them. This danger is always present in your everyday life. So as a listener or a disciple, it is necessary to clear your mind of these various distortions. A mind full of preconceived ideas, subjective intentions, or habits is not open to things as they are. That is why we practice zazen to clear our mind of what is related to something else. To be quite natural to ourselves, and also to follow what others say or do in the miost appropriate way, is quite difficult. If we try to adjust ourselves intentionally in some way, it is impossible to be natural. If you try to adjust yourself in a certain way, you will lose yourself. So without any intentional, fancy way of adjusting yourself, to express yourself freely as you are is the most important thing to make yourself happy, and to make others happy. You will acquire this kind of ability by practicing zazen. Zen is not some fancy, special art of living. Our teaching is just to live, always in reality, in its exact sense. To make our effort, moment after moment, is our way. In an exact sense, the only thing we actually can study in our life is that on which we are working in each moment. We cannot even study Buddha's words. To study Buddha's words in their exact sense means to study them through some activity which you face moment after moment. So we should be concentrated with our full mind and body on what we do and we should be faithful, subjectively and objectively, to ourselves, and especially to our feelings. Even when you do not feel so well, it is better to express how you feel without any particular attachment or intention. So you may say, Oh, I am sorry, I do not feel well. That is enough. You should not say, You made me so ! That is too much. You may say, Oh, I am sorry. I am so angry with you. There is no need to say that you are not angry when you are angry. You should just say, I am angry, That is enough. True communication depends upon our being straightforward with one another. Zen masters are very straightforward. If you do not understand the reality directly through your master's words, he may use his staff on you. What is it! he may say. Our way is very direct. But this is not actually Zen, you know. It is not our traditional way, but when we want to express it, we find it easier sometimes to express it in this way. But the best way to communicate may be just to sit without saying anything. Then you will have the full meaning of Zen. If I use my staff on you until I lose myself, or until you die, still it will not be enough. The best way is just to sit. Big mind is something to express, not something to figure out. Big mind is something you have, not something to seek for. The more you understand our thinking, the more you find it difficult to talk about it. The purpose of my talking is to give you some idea of our way, but actually, it is not something to talk about, but something to practice. The best way is just to practice without saying anything. When we talk about our way, there is apt to be some misunderstanding, because the true way always has at least tw A o sides, the negative and the positive. When we talk about the negative side, the positive side is missing, and when we talk about the positive side, the negative side is missing. We cannot speak in a positive and a negative way at the same time. So we do not know what to say. It is almost impossible to talk about Buddhism. So not to say anything, just to practice it, is the best way. Showing one finger or drawing a round circle may be the way, or simply to bow. If we understand this point, we will understand how to talk about Buddhism, and we will have perfect communication. To talk about something will be one of our practices, and to listen to the talk will also be practice. When we practice zazen we just practice zazen, without any gaining idea. When we talk about something we just talk about something, just the positive or the negative side, without trying to express some intellectual, onesided idea. And we listen without trying to figure out some intellectual understanding, without trying to understand fromjust a onesided view. This is how we talk about our teaching and how we listen to a talk. The Soto way always has double meaning, positive and negative. And our way is both Hinayanistic and Mahayanistic. I always say our practice is very Hinayanistic. Actually we have Hinayana practice with Mahayana spirit rigid formal practice with informal mind. Although our practice looks very formal, our minds are not formal. Although we practice zazen every morning in the same way, that is no reason to call this formal practice. It is your discrimination which makes it formal or informal. Inside the practice itself, there is no formal or informal. If you have Mahayana mind, something which people call formal may be informal. So we say that observing the precepts in a Hinayana way is violating the precepts in a Mahayana w A ay. If you observe our precepts in just a formal way, you lose your Mahayana spirit. Before you understand this point, you always have a problem: whether you should observe our way literally, or w A hether you should not concern yourself about the formality which we have. But if you understand our way completely, there is no such problem, because whatever you do is practice. As long as you have Mahayana mind, there is no Mahayana or Hinayana practice. Even though it seems as if you are violating the precepts, you are actually observing them in their true sense. The point is whether you have big mind or small mind. In short, when you do everything without thinking about whether it is good or bad, and when you do something with your whole mind and body, then that is our way. Dogenzenji said, When you say something to someone, he may not accept it, but do not try to make him understand it intellectually. Do not argue with him just listen to his objections until he himself finds something wrong with them. This is very interesting. Try not to force your idea on someone, but rather think about it with him. If you feel you have won the discussion, that also is the wrong attitude. Try not to win in the argument just listen to it but it is also wrong to behave as ifyou had lost. Usually vv'hen we say something, we are apt to try to sell our teaching or force our idea. But between Zen students there is no special purpose in speaking or in listening. Sometimes we listen, so'metimes we talk that is all. It is like a greeting: Good morning! Through this kind of communication we can develop our way. Not to say anything may be very good, but there is no reason why we should always be silent. Whatever you do, even including notdoing, that is our practice. That is an expression of big mind. So big mind is something to express, but it is not something to figure out. Big mind is something you have, not something to seek for. Big mind is something to talk about, or to express by our activity, or something to enjoy. If we do this, in our way of observing precepts there is no Hinayana way or Mahayana way. Only because you seek to gain something through rigid forraal practice does it become a problem for you. But if we appreciate whatever problem we have as an expression of big mind, it is not a problem anymore. Sometimes our problem is that big mind is very complicated sometimes big mind is too simple to figure out. That is also big mind. But because you try to figure out what it is, because you want to simplify the complicated big mind, it becomes a problc for you. So whether you have a problem in your life or not depends upon your own attitude, your own understanding. Because of the double or paradoxical nature of truth, there should be no problem of understanding if you have big Mahayana mind. This kind of mind will be obtained by true zazen. irvana, the waterfall Our life and death are the same thing. When we realize this fact, we have no fear of death anymore, nor actual difficulty in our life. If you go to Japan and visit Eiheiji monastery, just before you enter you will see a small bridge called Hanshakukyo, which means 'halfdipper bridge. Whenever Dogenzenji dipped water from the river, he used only half a dipperfiil, returning the rest to the river again, without throwing it away. That is why we call the bridge Hanshakukyo, HalfDipper Bridge. At Eiheiji when we wash our face, we fill the basin to just seventy percent of its capacity. And after we wash. we empty the water towards, rather than away from, our body. This expresses respect for the water. This kind of practice is not based on any idea of being economical. It may be difficult to understand why Dogen returned half of the water he dipped to the river. This kind of practice is beyond our thinking. When we feel the beauty of the river, when we are one with the water, we intuitively do it in Dogen's way. It is our true nature to do so. But if your true nature is covered by ideas of economy or efficiency, Dogen's way makes no sense. I went to Yosemite National Park, and I saw some huge waterfalls. The highest one there is , feet high, and from it the water comes down like a curtain thrown from the top of the mountain. It does not seem to come down swiftly, as you might expect it seems to come down very slowly because of the distance. And the water does not come down as one stream, but is separated into many tiny streams. From a distance it looks like a curtain. And I thought it must be a very difficult experience for each drop of water to come down from the top of such a high mountain. It takes time, you know, a long time, for the water finally to reach the bottom of the waterfall. And it seems to me that our human life may be like this. We have many difficult experiences in our life. But at the same time, I thought, the water was not originally separated, but was one whole river. Only when it is separated does it have some difficulty in falling. It is as if the water does not have any feeling when it is one whole river. Only when separated into many drops can it begin to have or to express some feeling. When we see one whole river we do not feel the living activity of the water, but when we dip apart of the water into a dipper, we experience some feeling of the water, and we also feel the value of the person who uses the water. Feeling ourselves and the watei in this way, we cannot use it in just a material way. It is a living thing. Before we were bom we had no feeling we were one with the universe. This is called mindonly, or essence , L of mind, or big mind, After we are separated by birth from this oneness, as the water falling from the waterfall is separated by the wind and rocks, then we have feeling. You have difficulty because you have feeling. You attach to the feeling you have without knowing just how this kind of feeling is created. When you do not realize that you are one with the river, or one with the universe, you have fear. Whether it is separated into drops or not, water is water. Our life and death are the same thing. When we realize this fact we have no fear of death anymore, and we have no actual difficulty in our life. When the water returns to its original oneness with the river, it no longer has any individual feeling to it it resumes its own nature, and finds composure. How very glad the water must be to come back to the original river! If this is so, what feeling will we have when we die I think we are like the water in the dipper. We will have composure then, perfect composure. It may be too perfect for us, just now, because we are so much attached to our own feeling, to our individual existence. For us, just now, we have some fear of death, but after we resume our true original nature, there is Nirvana, That is why we say, To attain Nirvana is to pass away, To pass away is not a very adequate expression. Perhaps to pass on, or to go on, or to join would be better. Will you try to find some better expression for death When you find it, you will have quite a new interpretation of your life. It will be like my experience when I saw the water in the big waterfall. Imagine! It was , feet high! We say, Everything comes out of emptiness. One whole river or one whole mind is emptiness. When we reach this understanding we find the true meaning of our life. When we reach this understanding we can see the beauty of human life. Before we realize this fact, everything that we see is just delusion. Sometimes we overestimate the beauty sometimes we underestimate or ignore the beauty because our small mind is not in accord with reality. To talk about it this way is quite easy, but to have the actual feeling is not so easy. But by your practice of zazen you can cultivate this feeling. When you can sit with your whole body and mind, and with the oneness of your mind and body under the control of the universal mind, you can easily attain this kind of right understanding. Your everyday life will be renewed without being attached to an old erroneous interpretation of life. When you realize this fact, you will discover how meaningless your old interpretation was, and how much useless effort you had been making. You will find the true meaning of life, and even though you have difficulty falling upright from the top of the waterfall to the bottom of the mountain, you will enjoy your life. , L Our understanding of Buddhism is not just an intellectual understanding. True understanding is actual practice itself. raditional zen spirit if you are trying to attain enlightenment, you are creating and being driven by karma, and you are wasting your time on your black cushion. The most important things in our practice are our physical posture and our way of breathing. We are not so concerned about a deep understanding of Buddhism. As a philosophy. Buddhism is a very deep, wide, and firm system of thought, but Zen is not concerned about philosophical understanding. We emphasize practice. We should understand why our physical posture and breathing exercise are so important. Instead of having a deep understanding of the teaching, we need a strong confidence in our teaching, which says that originally we have Buddha nature. Our practice is based on this faith. Before Bodhidharma went to China almost all the wellknown stock words of Zen were in use. For instance, there was the term, sudden enlightenment. Sudden enlightenment is not an adequate translation, but tentatively I will use the expression. Enlightenment comes all of a sudden to us. This is true enlightenment. Before Bodhidharma, people thought that after a long preparation, sudden enlightenment would come. Thus Zen practice was a kind of training to gain enlightenment. Actually, many people today are practicing zazen with this idea. But this is not the traditional understanding of Zen. The understanding passed down from Buddha to our time is that when you start zazen, there is enlightenment even without any preparation. Whether you practice zazen or not, you have Buddha nature. Because you have it, there is enlightenment in your practice. The points we emphasize are not the stage we attain, but the strong L confidence we have in our original nature and the sincerity of our practice. We should practice Zen with the same sincerity as Buddha. If originally we have Buddha nature, the reason we practice zazen is that we must behave like Buddha. To transmit our way is to transmit our spirit from Buddha. So we have to harmonize our spirit, our physical posture, and our activity with the traditional way. You may attain some particular stage, of course, but the spirit of your practice should not be based on an egoistic idea. According to the traditional Buddhist understanding, our human nature is without ego. When we have no idea of ego, we have Buddha's view of life. Our egoistic ideas are delusion, covering our Buddha nature. We are always creating and following them, and in repeating this process over and over again, our life becomes completely occupied by egocentered ideas. This is called karmic life, or karma. The Buddhist life should not be karmic life. The purpose of our practice is to cut off the karmic spinning mind. If you are trying to attain enlightenment, that is a part of karma, you are creating and being driven by karma, and you are wasting your time on your black cushion. According to Bodhidharma's understanding, practice based on any gaining idea is just a repetition of your karma. Forgetting this point, many later Zen masters have emphasized some stage to be attained by practice. More important than any stage which you will attain is your sincerity, your right effort. Right effort must be based on a true understanding of our traditional practice. When you understand this point you will understand how important it is to keep your posture right. When you do not understand this point, the posture and the way of breathing are just a means to attain enlightenment. If this is your attitude, it would be much better to take some drugs instead of sitting in the crosslegged position! If our practice is only a means to attain enlightenment, there is actually no way to attain it! We lose the meaning of the way to the goal. But when we believe in our way firmly, we have already attained enlightenment. When you believe in your wayj enlightenment is there. But when you cannot believe in the meaning of the practice which you are doing in this moment, you cannot do anything. You are just wandering around the goal with your monkey mind. You are always looking for something without knowing what you are doing. If you want to see something, you should open your eyes. When you do not understand Bodhidharma's Zen, you are trying to look at something with your eyes closed. We do not slight the idea of attaining enlightenment, but the most important thing is this moment, not some day in the future. We have to make our effort in this moment. This is the most important thing for our practice. Before Bodhidharma, the study of Buddha's teaching resulted in a deep and lofty philosophy of Buddhism, and people tried to attain its high ideals. This is a mistake. Bodhidharma discovered that it was a mistake to create some lofty or deep idea and then try to attain it by the practice of zazen. If that is our zazen, it is nothing different from our usual activity, or monkey mind. It looks like a very good, a very lofty and holy activity, but actually there is no difference between it and our monkey mind. That is the point that Bodhidharma emphasized. Before Buddha attained enlightenment he made all possible eflForts for us, and at last he attained a thorough understanding of the various ways. You may think Buddha attained some stage where he was free from karmic life, but it is not so. Many stories were told by Buddha about his experiences after he attained enlightenment. He was not at all different from us. When his country was at war with a powerful neighbor, he told his disciples of his own karma, of how he suffered when he saw that his country was going to be conquered by the neighboring king. If he had been someone who had attained an enlightenment in which there was no karma, there would have been no reason for him to suffer so. And even after he attained enlightenment he continued the same effort we are making. But his view of life was not L Q shaky. His view of hfe was stable, and he watched everyone's hfe, including his own life. He watched himself, and he watched others with the same eyes that he watched stones or plants, or anything else. He had a very scientific understanding. That was his way of life after he attained enlightenment. When we have the traditional spirit to follow the truth as it goes, and practice our way without any egoistic idea, then we will attain enlightenment in its true sense. And when we understand this point we will make our best effort in each moment. That is true understanding of Buddhism. So our understanding of Buddhism is not just an intellectual understanding. Our understanding at the same time is its own expression, is the practice itself. Not by reading or contemplation of philosophy, but only through practice, actual practice, can we understand what Buddhismi is. Constantly, we should practice a.zen, with strong confidence in our true nature, breaking the chain ofkarmic activity and finding our place in the world of actual practice. Y We should find perfect existence through imperfect existence. The basic teaching ofBuddhism is the teaching of transiency, or change. That everything changes is the basic truth for each existence. No one can deny this truth, and all the teaching of Buddhism is condensed within it. This is the teaching for all of us. Wherever we go this teaching is true. This teaching is also understood as the teaching of selflessness. Because each existence is in constant change, there is no abiding self. In fact, the selfnature of each existence is nothing but change itself, the selfnature of all existence. There is no special, separate selfnature for each existence. This is also called the teaching of Nirvana. When we realize the everlasting truth of everything changes and find our composure in it, we find ourselves in Nirvana. Without accepting the fact that everything changes, we cannot find perfect composure. But unfortunately, although it is true, it is difficult for us to accept it. Because we cannot accept the truth of transiency, we suffer. So the cause of suffering is our nonacceptance of this truth. The teaching of the cause of suffering and the teaching that everything changes are thus two sides of one coin. But subjectively, transiency is the cause of our suffering. Objectively this teaching is simply the basic truth that everything changes. Dogenzenji said, Teaching which does not sound as if it is forcing something on you is not true teaching. The teaching itself is true, and in itself does not force anything upon us, but because of our human tendency we receive the teaching as if something was being forced on us. But whether we feel good or bad about it, this truth exists. If nothing exists, this truth does not exist. Buddhism exists because of each particular existence. We should find perfect existence through imperfect existence. We should find perfection in imperfection. For us, complete perfection is not different from imperfection. The eternal exists because of noneternal existence. In Buddhism it is a heretical view to expect something outside this world. We do not seek for something besides ourselves. We should find the truth in this world, through our difficulties, through our suffering. This is the basic teaching of Buddhism. Pleasure is not different from difficulty. Good is not different from bad. Bad is good good is bad. They are two sides of one coin. So enlightenment should be in practice. That is the right understanding of practice, and the right understanding of our life. So to find pleasure in suffering is the only way to accept the truth of transiency. Without realizing how to accept this truth you cannot live in this world. Even though you try to escape from it, your effort will be in vain. If you think there is some other way to accept the eternal truth Y that everything changes, that is your delusion. This is the basic teaching of how to live in this world. Whatever you may feel about it, you have to accept it. You have to make this kind of effort. So until we become strong enough to accept difficulty as pleasure, we have to continue this effort. Actually, if you become honest enough, or straightforward enough, it is not so difficult to accept this truth. You can change your way of thinking a little bit. It is difficult, but this difficulty will not always be the same. Sometimes it will be difficult, and sometimes it will not be so difficult. If you are suffering, you vdll have some pleasure in the teaching that everything changes. When you are in trouble, it is quite easy to accept the teaching. So why not accept it at other times It is the same thing. Sometimes you may laugh at yourself, discovering how selfish you are. But no matter how you feel about this teaching, it is very important for you to change your way of thinking and accept the truth of transiency. Y F When you do something, ifyou fix your mind on the activity with some confidence, the quality of your state of mind is the activity itself. When you are concentrated on the quality of your being, you are prepared for the activity. The purpose of zazen is to attain the freedom of our being, physically and mentally. According to Dogenzenji, every existence is a flashing into the vast phenomenal world. Each existence is another expression of the quality of being itself. I often see many stars early in the morning. The stars are nothing but the light which has traveled at great speed many miles from the heavenly bodies. But for me the stars are not speedy beings, but calm, steady, and peaceful beings. We say, In calmness there should be activity in activity there should be calmness. Actually, they are the same thing to say calmness or to say activity is just to express two different interpretations of one fact. There is harmony in our activity, and where there is harmony there is calnmess. This harmony is the quality of being. But the quality of being is also nothing but its speedy activity. When we sit we feel very calm and serene, but actually we do not know what kind of activity is going on inside our being. There is complete harmony in the activity of our physical system, so we feel the calmness in it. Even if we do not feel it, the quality is there. So for us there is no need to be bothered by calmness or activity, stillness or movement. When you do something, ifyou fix your mind on the activity with some confidence, the quality of your state of mind is the activity itself. When you are concentrated on the quality of your being, you are prepared for the activity. Movement is nothing but the quality of our being. When we do zazen, the quality of our calm, steady, serene sitting is the quality of the immense activity of being itself. Everything is just a flashing into the vast phenomenal world means the freedom of our activity and of our being. If you sit in the right manner, with the right understanding, you attain the freedom of your being, even though you are just a temporal existence. Within this moment, this temporal existence does not change, does not move, and is always independent from other existences. In the next moment another existence arises we may change to something else. Strictly speaking, there is no connection between I myself yesterday and I myself in this moment there is no connection whatsoever. Dogenzenji said, Charcoal does not become ashes. Ashes are ashes they do not belong to charcoal. They have their own past and future. They are an independent existence because they are a flashing into the vast phenomenal world. And charcoal and redhot fire are quite different existences. Black charcoal is also a flashing into the vast phenomenal world. Where there is black charcoal there is not redhot charcoal. So black charcoal is Y F independent of redhot charcoal ashes are independent of firewood each existence is independent. Today I am sitting in Los Altos. Tomorrow morning I shall be in San Francisco. There is no connection between the I in Los Altos and the I in San Francisco. They are quite different beings. Flere we have the freedom of existence . And there is no quality connecting you and me when I say you, there is no I when I say , there is no you. You are independent, and I am independent each exists in a different moment. But this does not mean we are quite different beings. We are actually one and the same being. We are the same, and yet different. It is very paradoxical, but actually it is so. Because we are independent beings, each one of us is a complete flashing into the vast phenomenal world. When I am sitting, there is no other person, but this does not mean I ignore you, I am completely one with every existence in the phenomenal world. So when I sit, you sit everything sits with me. That is our zazen. When you sit, everything sits with you. And everything makes up the quality of your being. I am a part of you. I go into the quality of your being. So in this practice we have absolute liberation from everything else. If you understand this secret there is no difference between Zen practice and your everyday life. You can interpret everything as you wish, A wonderful painting is the result of the feeling in your fingers. If you have the feeling of the thickness of the ink in your brush, the painting is already there before you paint. When you dip your brush into the ink you already know the result of your drawing, or else you cannot paint. So before you do something, being is there, the result is there. Even though you look as if you were sitting quietly, all your activity, past and present, is included and the result of your sitting is also already there. You are not resting at all. All the activity is included within you. That is your being. So all results of your practice are included in your sitting. This is our practice, our zazen, Dogenzenji became interested in Buddhism as a boy as he watched the smoke from an incense stick burning by his dead mother's body, and he felt the evanescence of our life. This feeling grew within him and finally resulted in his attainment of enlightenment and the development of his deep philosophy. When he saw the smoke from the incense stick and felt the evanescence of life, he felt very lonely. But that lonely feeling became stronger and stronger, and flowered into enlightenment when he was twentyeight years old. And at the moment of enlightenment he exclaimed, There is no body and no mind! When he said no body and no mind, all his being in that moment became a flashing into the vast phenomenal world, a flashing which included everything, which covered everything, and which had immense quality in it all the phenomenal world was included within it, an absolute independent existence. That was his enlightenment. Starting from the lonely feeling of the evanescence of life, he attained the powerful experience of the quality of his being. He said, I have dropped off mind and body. Because you think you have body or mind, you have lonely feelings, but when you realize that everything is just a flashing into the vast universe, you become very strong, and your existence becomes very meaningful. This was Dogen's enlightenment, and this is our practice. Moment after moment, everyone comes out from nothingness. This is the true joy of life. There is a big misunderstanding about the idea of naturalness. Most people who come to us believe in some freedom or naturalness, but their understanding is what we call jinen ken gedo, or heretical naturalness. Jinen ken gedo means that there is no need to be formal just a kind of letalone policy or sloppiness. That is naturalness for most people. But that is not the naturalness we mean. It is rather difficult to explain, but naturalness is, I think, some feeling ofbeing independent from everything, or some activity which is based on nothingness. Something which comes out of nothingness is naturalness, like a seed or plant coming out of the ground. The seed has no idea ofbeing some particular plant, but it has its own form and is in perfect harmony with the ground, with its surroundings. As it grows, in the course of time it expresses its nature. Nothing exists without form and color. Whatever it is, it has some form and color, and that form and color are in perfect harmony with other beings. And there is no trouble. That is what we mean by naturalness. For a plant or stone to be natural is no problem. But for us there is some problem, indeed a big problem. To be natural is something which we must work on. When what you do just comes out from nothingness, you have quite a new feeling. For instance, when you are hungry, to take some food is naturalness. You feel natural. But when you are expecting too much, to have some food is not natural. You have no new feeling. You have no appreciation for it. The true practice of zazen is to sit as if drinking water when you are thirsty. There you have naturalness. It is quite natural for you to take a nap when you are very sleepy. But to take a nap just because you are lazy, as if it were the privilege of a human being to take a nap, is not naturalness. You think, My friends, all of them, are napping why shouldn't I When everyone else is not working, why should I work so hard When they have a lot of money, why don't I This is not naturalness. Your mind is entangled with some other idea, someone else's idea, and you are not independent, not yourself, and not natural. Even ifyou sit in the crosslegged position, if your zazen is not natural, it is not true practice. You do not have to force yourself to drink water when you are thirsty you are glad to drink water. If you have true joy in your zazen, that is true zazen. But even though you have to force yourself to practice zazen, if you feel something good in your practice, that is zazen. Actually it is not a matter of forcing something on you or not. Even though you have some difficulty, when you want to have it, that is naturalness. This naturalness is very difficult to explain. But if you can just sit and experience the actuality of nothingness in your practice, there is no need to explain. If it comes out of nothingness, whatever you do is natural, and that is true activity. You have the true joy of practice, the true joy of life in it. Everyone comes out from nothingness moment after moment. Moment after moment we have true joy of life. So we say shin ku myo u, from true emptiness, the wondrous being appears. Shin is true ku is emptiness myo is wondrous u is being : from true emptiness, wondrous being. Without nothingness, there is no naturalness no true being. True being comes out of nothingness, moment after moment. Nothingness is always there, and from it everything appears. But usually, forgetting all about nothingness, you behave as if you have something. What you do is based on some possessive idea or some concrete idea, and that is not natural. For instance, when you listen to a lecture, you should not have any idea of yourself. You should not have your own idea when you listen to someone. Forget what you have in your mind and just listen to what he says. To have nothing in your mind is naturaliess. Then you will understand what he says. But if you have some idea to compare with what he says, you will not hear everything your understanding will be onesided that is not naturalness. When you do something, you should be completely involved in it. You should devote yourself to it completely. Then you have nothing. So if there is no true emptiness in your activity, it is not natural. Most people insist on some idea. Recently the younger generation talks about love. Love! Love! Love! Their minds are full of love! And when they study Zen, if what I say does not accord with the idea they have of love, they will not accept it. They are quite stubborn, you know. You may be amazed! Of course not all, but some have a very, very hard attitude. That is not naturalness at all. Even though they talk about love, and freedom or naturalness, they do not understand these things. And they cannot understand what Zen is in that way. If you want to study Zen, you should forget all your previous ideas and just practice zazen and see what kind of experience you have in your practice. That is naturalness. Whatever you do, this attitude is necessary. Sometimes we say nyu nan shin, soft or flexible mind. Nyu is soft feeling nan is something which is not hard shin is mind. Nyu nan shin means a smooth, natural mind. When you have that mind, you have the joy of life. When you lose it, you lose everything. You have nothing. Although you think you have something, you have nothing But when all you do comes out of nothingness, then you have everything. Do you understand That is what we mean by naturalness. When you study Buddhism you should have a general house cleaning of your mind. If you want to understand Buddhism it is necessary for you to forget all about your preconceived ideas. To begin with, you must give up the Idea of substantiality or existence. The usual view of life is firmly rooted in the idea of existence. For most people everything exists they think whatever they see and whatever they hear exists. Of course the bird we see and hear exists. It exists, but what I mean by that may not be exactly what you mean. The Buddhist understanding of life includes both existence and nonexistence. The bird both exists and does not exist at the same time. We say that a view of life based on existence alone is heretical. If you take things too seriously, as if they existed substantially or permanently, you are called a heretic. Most people may be heretics. We say true existence comes from emptiness and goes back again into emptiness. What appears from emptiness is true existence. We have to go through the gate of emptiness. This idea of existence is very difficult to explain. Many people these days have begun to feel, at least intellectually, the emptiness of the modem world, or the selfcontradiction of their culture. In the past, for instance, the Japanese people had a firm confidence in the permanent existence of their culture and their traditional way of life, but since they lost the war, they have become very skeptical. Some people think this skeptical attitude is awful, but actually it is better than the old attitude. As long as we have some definite idea about or some hope in the future, we cannot really be serious with the moment that exists right now. You may say, I can do it tomorrow, or next year, believing that something that exists today will exist tomorrow. Even though you are not trying so hard, you expect that some promising thing will come, as long as you follow a certain way. But there is no certain way that exists permanently. There is no way set up for us. Moment after moment we have to find our own way. Some idea of perfection, or some perfect way which is set up by someone else, is not the true way for us. Each one of us must make his own true way, and when we do, that way will express the universal way. This is the mystery. When you understand one thing through and through, you understand everything. When you try to understand everything, you will not understand anything. The best way is to understand yourself, and then you will understand everything. So when you try hard to make your own way, you will help others, and you will be helped by others. Before you make your own way you cannot help anyone, and no one can help you. To be independent in this true sense, we have to forget everything which we have in our mind and discover something quite new and different moment after moment. This is how we live in this world. So we say true understanding will come out of emptiness. When you study Buddhism, you should have a general house cleaning of your mind. You must take everything out of your room and clean it thoroughly. If it is necessary, you may Q bring everything back in again. You may want many things, so one by one you can bring them back. But if they are not necessary, there is no need to keep them. We see the flying bird. Sometimes we see the trace of it. Actually we cannot see the trace of a flying bird, but sometimes we feel as if we could. This is also good. If it is necessary, you should bring back in the things you took from your room. But before you put something in your room, it is necessary for you to take out something. If you do not, your room will become crowded with old, useless junk. We say, Step by step I stop the sound of the murmuring brook. When you walk along the brook you will hear the water running. The sound is continuous, but you must be able to stop it if you want to stop it. This is freedom this is renunciation. One after another you will have various thoughts in your mind, but if you want to stop your thinking you can. So when you are able to stop the sound of the murmuring brook, you will appreciate the feeling of your work. But as long as you have some fixed idea or are caught by some habitual way of doing things, you cannot appreciate things in their true sense. If you seek for freedom, you cannot find it. Absolute freedom itself is necessary before you can acquire absolute freedom . That is our practice. Our way is not always to go in one direction. Sometimes we go east sometimes we go west. To go one mile to the west means to go back one mile to the east. Usually if you go one mile to the east it is the opposite of going one mile to the west. But if it is possible to go one mile to the east, that means it is possible to go one mile to the west. This is freedom. Without this freedom you cannot be concentrated on what you do. You may think you are concentrated on something, but before you obtain this freedom, you will have some uneasiness in what you are doing. Because you are bound by some idea of going east or west, your activity is in dichotomy or duality. As long as you are caught by duality you cannot attain absolute freedom, and you cannot concentrate. Concentration is not to try hard to watch something. In zazen if you try to look at one spot you will be tired in about five minutes. This is not concentration. Concentration means freedom. So your effort should be directed at nothing. You should be concentrated on nothing. In zazen practice we say your mind should be concentrated on your breathing, but the way to keep your mind on your breathing is to forget all about yourself and just to sit and feel your breathing. If you are concentrated on your breathing you will forget yourself, and if you forget yourself you will be concentrated on your breathing. I do not know which is first. So actually there is no need to try too hard to be concentrated on your breathing. Just do as much as you can. If you continue this practice, eventually you will experience the true existence which comes from emptiness. eadiness, mindfulness it is the readiness of the mind that is wisdom. In the Prajna Paramita Sutra the most important point, of course, is the idea of emptiness. Before we understand the idea of emptiness, everything seems to exist substantially. But after we realize the emptiness of things, everything becomes real not substantial. When we realize that everything we see is a part of emptiness, we can have no attachment to any existence we realize that everything is just a tentative form and color. Thus we realize the true meaning of each tentative existence. When we first hear that everything is a tentative existence, most of us are disappointed but this disappointment comes from a wrong view of man and nature. It is because our way of observing things is deeply rooted in our selfcentered ideas that we are disappointed when we find everything has only a tentative existence. But when we actually realize this truth, we will have no suffering. This sutra says, Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara observes that , everything is emptiness, thus he forsakes all suffering. It was not after he realized this truth that he overcame suffering to realize this fact is itself to be relieved from suffering. So realization of the truth is salvation itself. We say, to realize, but the realization of the truth is always near at hand. It is not after we practice zazen that we realize the truth even before we practice zazen, realization is there. It is not after we understand the truth that we attain enlightenment. To realize the truth is to live to exist here and now. So it is not a matter of understanding or of practice. It is an ultimate fact. In this sutra Buddha is referring to the ultimate fact that we always face moment after moment. This point is very important. This is Bodhidharma's zazen. Even before we practice it, enlightenment is there. But usually we understand the practice of zazen and enlightenment as two different things: here is practice, like a pair of glasses, and when we use the practice, like putting the glasses on, we see enlightenment. This is the wrong understanding. The glasses themselves are enlightenment, and to put them on is also enlightenment. So whatever you do, or even though you do not do anything, enlightenment is there, always. This is Bodhidharma's understanding of enlightenment. You cannot practice true zazen, because you practice it if you do not, then there is enlightenment, and there is true practice. When you do it, you create some concrete idea of you or , and you create some particular idea of practice or zazen. So here you are on the right side, and here is zazen on the left. So zazen and you become two different things. If the combination of practice and you is zazen, it is the zazen of a frog. For a frog, his sitting position is zazen. When a frog is hopping, that is not zazen. This kind of misunderstanding will vanish if you really understand emptiness means everything is always here. One whole being is not an accumulation of everything. It is impossible to divide one whole existence into parts. It is always here and always working. This is enlightenment. So there actually is no particular practice. In the sutra it says, There are no eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue, no body or mind. ... This no mind is Zen mind, which includes everything. The important thing in our understanding is to have a smooth, freethinking way of observation. We have to think and to observe things without stagnation. We should accept things as they are without difficulty. Our mind should be soft and open enough to understand things as they are. When our thinking is soft, it is called imperturbable thinking. This kind of thinking is always stable. It is called mindfulness. Thinking which is divided in many ways is not true thinking. Concentration should be present in our thinking. This is mindfulness. Whether you have an object or not, your mind should be stable and your mind should not be divided. This is zazen. It is not necessary to make an effort to think in a particular way. Your thinking should not be onesided. We just think with our whole mind, and see things as they are without any effort. Just to see, and to be ready to see things with our whole mind, is zazen practice. If we are prepared for thinking, there is no need to make an effort to think. This is called mindfulness. Mindfulness is, at the same time, wisdom. By wisdom we do not mean some particular faculty or philosophy. It is the readiness of the mind that is wisdom. So wisdom could be various philosophies and teachings, and various kinds of research and studies. But we should not become attached to some particular wisdom, such as that which was taught by Buddha, Wisdom is not something to leam. Wisdom is something which will come out of your mindfulness. So the point is to be ready for observing things, and to be ready for thinking. This is called emptiness of your mind. Emptiness is nothing but the practice of zazen. , In our everyday life our thinking is ninetynine percent selfcentered. 'Why do have suffering Why do have trouble I discovered that it is necessary, absolutely necessary, to believe in nothing. That is, we have to believe in something which has no form and no color something which exists before all forms and colors appear. This is a very important point. No matter what god or doctrine you believe in, if you become attached to it, your belief will be based more or less on a selfcentered idea. You strive for a perfect faith in order to save yourself. But it will take time to attain such a perfect faith. You will be involved in an idealistic practice. In constantly seeking to actualize your ideal, you will have no time for composure. But if you are always prepared for accepting everything we see as something appearing from nothing, knowing that there is some reason why a phenomenal existence of such and such form and color appears, then at that moment you will have perfect composure. When you have a headache, there is some reason why you have a headache. If you know why you have a headache, you will feel better. But if you do not know why, you may say, Oh, I have a terrible headache! Maybe it is because of my bad practice. If my meditation or Zen practice were better I wouldn't have this kind of trouble! If you understand conditions in this way you will not have perfect faith in yourself, or in your practice, until you attain perfection. You will be so busy trying that I am afraid you will have no time to attain perfect practice, so you may have to keep your headache all the time! This is a rather silly kind of practice. This kind of practice will not work. But if you believe in something which exists before you had the headache, and if you know the reason why you have the headache, then you will feel better, naturally. To have a headache will be all right, because you are healthy enough to have a headache. If you have a stomachache, your stomach is healthy enough to have pain. But if your stomach becomes accustomed to its poor condition, you will have no pain. That is awful! You will be coming to the end of your life from your stomach trouble. So it is absolutely necessary for everyone to believe in nothing. But I do not mean voidness. There is something, but that something is something which is always prepared for taking some particular form, and it has some rules, or theory, or truth in its activity. This is called Buddha nature, or Buddha himself. When this existence is personified we call it Buddha when we understand it as the ultimate truth we call it Dharma and when we accept the truth and act as a part of the Buddha, or according to the theory, we call ourselves Sangha. But even though there are three Buddha forms, it is one existence which has no form or color, and it is always ready to take form and color. This is not just theory. This is not just the teaching of Buddhism. This is the absolutely necessary understanding of our life. Without this understanding our religion will not help us. We will be bound by our religion, and we will have more trouble because of it. If you become the victim of Buddhism, I may be very happy, but you will not be so happy. So this kind of understanding is very, very important. While you are practicing zazen, you may hear the rain dropping from the roof in the dark. Later, the wonderful mist will be coming through the big trees, and still later when people start to work, they will see the beautiful mountains. But some people will be annoyed if they hear the rain when they are lying in their beds in the morning, because they do not know that later they will see the beautiful sun rising from the east. If our mind is concentrated on ourselves we will have this kind of worry. But if we accept ourselves as the embodiment of the truth, or Buddha nature, we will have no worry. We will think, Now it is raining, but we don't know what will happen in the next moment. By the time we go out it may be a beautiful day, or a stormy day. Since we don't know, let's appreciate the sound of the rain now. This kind of attitude is the right attitude. If you understand yourself as a temporal embodiment of the truth, you will have no difficulty whatsoever. You will appreciate your surroundings, and you will appreciate yourself as a wonderful part of Buddha's great activity, even in the midst of difficulties. This is our way of life. Using the Buddhist terminology, we should begin with enlightenment and proceed to practice, and then to thinking. Usually thinking is rather selfcentered. In our everyday life our thinking is ninetynine percent selfcentered: ' 'Why do I have suffering Why do I have trouble This kind of thinking is ninetynine percent of our thinking. For example, when we start to study science or read a difficult sutra, we very soon become sleepy or drowsy. But we are always wide awake and very much interested in our selfcentered thinking ! But if enlightenment comes first, before thinking, before practice, your thinking and your practice will not be selfcentered. By enlightenment I mean believing in nothing, believing in something which has no form or no color, which is ready to take form or color. This enlightenment is the immutable truth. It is on this original truth that our activity, our thinking, and our practice should be based. A ttachment, nonattachment That we are attached to some beauty is also Buddha's activity. Dogenzenji said, Even though it is midnight, dawn is here even though dawn comes, it is nighttime. This kind of statement conveys the understanding transmitted from Buddha to the Patriarchs, and from the Patriarchs to Dogen, and to us. Nighttime and daytime are not different. The same thing is sometimes called nighttime, sometimes called daytime. They are one thing. Zazen practice and everyday activity are one thing. We call zazen everyday life, and everyday life zazen. But usually we think, Now zazen is over, and we will go about our everyday activity. But this is not the right understanding. They are the same thing. We have nowhere to escape. So in activity there should be calmness, and in calmness there should be activity. Calmness and activity are not different. Each existence depends on something else. Strictly speaking, there are no separate individual existences. There are just many names for one existence. Sometimes people put stress on oneness, but this is not our understanding. We do not emphasize any point in particular, even oneness. Oneness is valuable, but variety is also wonderful. Ignoring variety, people emphasize the one absolute existence, but this is a onesided understanding. In this understanding there is a gap between variety and oneness. But oneness and variety are the same thing, so oneness should be appreciated in each existence. That is why we emphasize everyday life rather than some particular state of mind. We should find the reality in each moment, and in each phenomenon. This is a very important point. Dogenzenji said, Although everything has Buddha nature, we love flowers, and we do not care for weeds. This is true of human nature. But that we are attached to some beauty is itself Buddha's activity. That we do not care for weeds is also Buddha's activity. We should know that. If you know that, it is all right to attach to something. If it is Buddha's attachment, that is nonattachment. So in love there should be hate, or nonattachment. And in hate there should be love, or acceptance. Love and hate are one thing. We should not attach to love alone. We should accept hate. We should accept weeds, despite how we feel about them. If you do not care for them, do not love them if you love them, then love them. Usually you criticize yourself for being unfair to your surroundings you criticize your unaccepting attitude. But there is a very subtle difference between the usual way of accepting and our way of accepting things, although they , C J may seem exactly the same. We have been taught that there is no gap between nighttime and daytime, no gap between you and . This means oneness. But we do not emphasize even oneness. Ifit is one, there is no need to emphasize one. Dogen said, To learn something is to know yourself to study Buddhism is to study yourself, To learn something is not to acquire something which you did not know before. You know something before you learn it. There is no gap between the I before you know something and the I after you know something. There is no gap between the ignorant and the wise. A foolish person is a wise person a wise person is a foolish person. But usually we think, He is foolish and am wise, or I was foolish, but now I am wise. How can we be wise if we are foolish But the understanding transmitted from Buddha to us is that there is no difference whatsoever between the foolish man and the wise man. It is so. But if say this people may think that I am emphasizing oneness. This is not so. We do not emphasize anything. All we want to do is to know things just as they are. If we know things as they are, there is nothing to point at there is no way to grasp anything there is no thing to grasp. We cannot put emphasis on any point. Nevertheless, as Dogen said, A flower falls, even though we love it and a weed grows, even though we do not love it. Even though it is so, this is our life. In this way our life should be understood. Then there is no problem. Because we put emphasis on some particular point, we always have trouble. We should accept things just as they are. This is how we understand everything, and how we live in this world. This kind of experience is something beyond our thinking. In the thinking realm there is a difference between oneness and variety but in actual experience, variety and unity are the same. Because you create some idea of unity or variety, you are caught by the idea. And you have to continue the endless thinking, although actually there is no need to think. Emotionally we have many problems, but these problems are not actual problems they are sorfiething created they are problems pointed out by our selfcentered ideas or views. Because we point out something, there are problems. But actually it is not possible to point out anything in particular. Happiness is sorrow sorrow is happiness. There is happiness in difficulty difficulty in happiness. Even though the ways we feel are different, they are not really different, in essence they are the same. This is the true understanding transmitted from Buddha to us. C For Zen students a weed is a f treasure. A Zen poem says, After the wand stops I see a flower falling. Because of the singing bird I find the motmtain calmness. Before something happens in the realm of calmness, we do not feei the calmness only when something happens within it do we find the calmness. There is a Japanese saying, For the moon there is the cloud. For the flower there is the wind. When we see a part of the moon covered by a cloud, or a tree, or a weed, we feel how round the moon is. But when we see the clear moon without anything covering it, we do not feel that roundness the same way we do when we see it through something else. When you are doing zazen, you are within the complete calmness of your mind you do not feel anything. You just sit. But the calmness of your sitting will encourage you in your everyday life. So actually you will find the value of Zen in your everyday life, rather than while you sit. But this does not mean you should neglect zazen. Even though you do not feel anything when you sit, if you do not have this zazen experience, you cannot find anything you just find weeds, or trees, or clouds in your daily life you do not see the moon. That is why you are always complaining about something. But for Zen students a weed, which for most people is worth less, is a treasure. With this attitude, whatever you do, life becomes an art. When you practice zazen you should not try to attain anything. You should just sit in the complete calmness of your mind and not rely on anything. Just keep your body straight without leaning over or against something. To keep your body straight means not to rely on anything. In this way, physically and mentally, you will obtain complete calmness. But to rely on something or to try to do something in zazen is dualistic and not complete calmness. In our everyday life we are usually trying to do something, trying to change something into something else, or trying to attain something. Just this trying is already in itself an expression of our true nature. The meaning lies in the effort itself. We should find out the meaning of our effort before we attain something. So Dogen said, We should attain enlightenment before we attain enlightenment. It is not after attaining enlightenment that we find its true meaning. The trying to do something in itself is enlightenment. When we are in difficulty or distress, there we have enlightenment. When we are in defilement, there we should have composure. Usually we find it very difficult to live in the evanescence of life, but it is only within the evanescence of life that we can find the joy of eternal life. By continuing your practice with this sort of understanding, you can improve yourself. But if you try to attain something without this understanding you cannot work on it properly. You lose yourself in the struggle for your goal you achieve nothing you just continue to suffer in your difficulties. But with right understanding you can make some progress. Then whatever you do, even though not perfect, will be based on your inmost nature, and little by little something will be achieved. Which is more important to attain enlightenment, or to attain enlightenment before you attain enlightenment to make a million dollars, or to enjoy your life in your effort, little by little, even though it is impossible to make that million to be successful, or to find some meaning in your effort to be successful If you do not know the answer, you will not even be able to practice zazen if you do know, you will have found the true treasure of life. xperience, not philosophy There is something blasphemous in talking about how Buddhism is perfect as a philosophy or teaching without knowing what it actually is. Although there are many people in this country who are interested in Buddhism, few of them are interested in its pure form. Most of them are interested in studying the teaching or the philosophy of Buddhism. Comparing it to other religions, they appreciate how satisfying Buddhism is intellectually. But whether Buddhism is philosophically deep or good or perfect is not the point. To keep our practice in its pure form is our purpose. Sometimes I feel there is something blasphemous in talking about how Buddhism is perfect as a philosophy or teaching without knowing what it actually is. To practice zazen with a group is the most important thing for Buddhism and for us because this practice is the original way of life. Without knowing the origin of things we cannot appreciate the result of our life's effort. Our effort must have some meaning. To find the meaning of our effort is to find the original source of our effort. We should not be concerned about the result of our effort before we know its origin. If the origin is not clear and pure, our effort will not be pure, and its result will not satisfy us. When we resume our original nature and incessantly make our effort from this base, we will appreciate the result of our effort moment after moment, day after day, year after year. This is how we should appreciate our life. Those who are attached only to the result of their effort will not have any chance to appreciate it, because the result will never come. But if moment . Y by moment your effort arises from its pure origin, all you do will be good, and you will be satisfied with whatever you do. Zazen practice is the practice in which we resume our pure way of life, beyond any gaining idea, and beyond fame and profit. By practice we just keep our original nature as it is. There is no need to intellectualize about what our pure original nature is, because it is beyond our intellectual understanding. And there is no need to appreciate it, because it is beyond our appreciation. So just to sit, without any idea of gain, and with the purest intention, to remain as quiet as our original nature this is our practice. In the zendo there is nothing fancy. We just come and sit. After communicating with each other we go home and resume our own everyday activity as a continuity of our pure practice, enjoying our true way of life. Yet this is very unusual. Wherever I go people ask me, What is Buddhism with their notebooks ready to write down my answer. You can iraagine how feel! But here we just practice zazen. That is all we do, and we are happy in this practice. For us there is no need to understand what Zen is. We are practicing zazen. So forus there is no need to know what Zen is intellectually. This is, I think, very unusual for American society. In America there are many patterns of life and many religions, so it may seem quite natural to talk about the differences between the various religions and compare one with the other. But for us there is no need to compare Buddhism to Christianity. Buddhism is Buddhism, and Buddhism is our practice. We do not even know what we are doing when we just practice with a pure mind. So we cannot compare our way to some other religion. Some people may say that Zen Buddhism is not religion. Maybe that is so, or maybe Zen Buddhism is religion before religion. So it might not be religion in the usual sense. But it is wonderful, and even though we do not study what it is intellectually, even though we do not have any cathedral or fancy ornaments, it is possible to appreciate our original nature. This is, I think, quite unusual. L M Actually, we are not the Soto school at all. We are just Buddhists. We are not even Zen Buddhists. If we understand this point, we are truly Buddhists. Walking, standing, sitting, and lying down are the four activities or ways of behavior in Buddhism. Zazen is not one of the four ways ofbehavior, and according to Dogenzenji, the Soto school is not one of the many schools of Buddhism. The Chinese Soto school maybe one ofthe many schools of Buddhism, but according to Dogen, his way was not one ofthe many schools. If this is so, you may ask why we put emphasis on the sitting posture or why we put emphasis on having a teacher. The reason is because zazen is not just one of the four ways of behavior. Zazen is a practice which contains innumerable activities zazen started even before Buddha, and will continue forever. So this sitting posture cannot be compared to the other four activities. Usually people put emphasis on some particular position or on some particular understanding of Buddhism, and they think, ' 'This is Buddhism! But we cannot compare our way with the practices people normally understand. Our teaching cannot be compared to other teachings of Buddhism. This is why we should have a teacher who does not attach to any particular understanding of Buddhism. The original teaching of Buddha includes all the various schools. As Buddhists our traditional effort should be like Buddha's: we should not attach to any particular school or doctrine. But usually, if we have no teacher, and if we take pride in our own understanding, we will lose the original characteristic of Buddha's teaching, which includes all the various teachings. Because Buddha was the founder of the teaching, people tentatively called his teaching Buddhism, but actually Buddhism is not some particular teaching. Buddhism, is just Truth, which includes various truths in it. Zazen practice is the practice which includes the various activities of life. So L M actually, we do not emphasize the sitting posture alone. How to sit is how to act. We study how to act by sitting, and this is the most basic activity for us. That is why we practice zazen in this way. Even though we practice zazen, we should not call ourselves the Zen school. We just practice zazen, taking our example from Buddha that is why we practice. Buddha taught us how to act through our practice that is why we sit. To do something, to live in each moment, means to be the temporal activity of Buddha. To sit in this way is to be Buddha himself, to be as the historical Buddha was. The same thing applies to everything we do. Everything is Buddha's activity. So whatever you do, or even if you keep from doing something, Buddha is in that activity. Because people have no such understanding of Buddha, they think what they do is the most important thing, without knowing who it is that is actually doing it. People think they are doing various things, but actually Buddha is doing everything. Each one of us has his own name, but those names are the many names of one Buddha. Each one of us has many activities, but those activities are all Buddha's activities. Without knowing this, people put emphasis on some activity. When they put emphasis on zazen, it is not true zazen. It looks as if they were sitting in the same way as Buddha, but there is a big difference in their understanding of our practice. They understand this sitting posture as just one of the four basic postures of man, and they think: I now take this posture. But zazen is all the postures, and each posture is Buddha's posture. This understanding is the right understanding of the zazen posture. If you practice in this way, it is Buddhism. This is a very, very important point. So Dogen did not call himself a Soto teacher or a Soto disciple. He said, Other people may call us the Soto school, but there is no reason for us to call ourselves Soto. You should not even use the name of Soto. No school should consider itself a separate school. It should just be one tentative form of Buddhism. But as long as the various schools do not accept this kind of understanding, as long as they continue calling themselves by their particular names, we must accept the tentative name of Soto. But I want to make this point clear. Actually we are not the Soto school at all. We are just Buddhists. We are not even Zen Buddhists we are just Buddhists. If we understand this point we are truly Buddhists. Buddha's teaching is everywhere. Today it is raining. This is Buddha's teaching. People think their own way or their own religious understanding is Buddha's way, without knowing what they are hearing, or what they are doing, or where they are. Religion is not any particular teaching. Religion is everywhere. We have to understand our teaching in this way. We should forget all about some particular teaching we should not ask which is good or bad. There should not be any particular teaching. Teaching is in each moment, in every existence. That is the true teaching. To realize pure mind in your delusion is practice, If you try to expel the delusion it will only persist the more. Just say, 'Oh, this is just delusion, ' and do not be bothered by it. We should establish our practice where there is no practice or enlightenment. As long as we practice zazen in the area where there is practice and enlightenment, there is no chance to make perfect peace for ourselves. In other words, we must firmly believe in our true nature. Our true nature is beyond our conscious experience. It is only in our conscious experience that we find practice and enlightenment or good and bad. But whether or not we have experience of our true nature, what exists there, beyond consciousness, actually exists, and it is there that we have to establish the foundation of our practice. Even to have a good thing in your mind is not so good. Buddha sometimes said, You should be like this. You ought not to be like that. But to have what he says in your mind is not so good. It is a kind of burden for you, and you may not actu ally feel so good. In fact to harbor some ill will may even be better than to have some idea in your m.ind of what is good or of what you ought to do. To have some mischievous idea in your mind is sometimes very agreeable. That is true. Actually, good and bad is not the point. Whether or not you make yourself peaceful is the point, and whether or not you stick to it. When you have something in your consciousness you do not have perfect composure. The best way towards perfect composure is to forget everything. Then your mind is calm, and it is wide and clear enough to see and feel things as they are without any effort. The best way to find perfect composure is not to retain any idea of things, whatever they may be to forget all about them and not to leave any trace or shadow of thinking. But if you try to stop your mind or try to go beyond your conscious activity, that will only be another burden for you. I have to stop my mind in my practice, but I cannot. My practice is not so good. This kind of idea is also the wrong way of practice. Do not try to stop your mind, but leave everything as it is. Then things will not stay in your mind so long. Things will come as they come and go as they go. Then eventually your clear, empty mind will last fairly long. So to have a firm conviction in the original emptiness of your mind is the most important thing in your practice. In Buddhist scriptures we sometimes use vast analogies in an attempt to describe empty mind. Sometimes we use an astronomically great number, so great it is beyond counting. This means to give up calculating. If it is so great that you cannot count it, then you will lose your interest and eventually give up. This kind of description may also give rise to a kind of interest in the innumerable number, which will help you to stop the thinking of your small mind. But it is when you sit in zazen that you will have the most pure, genuine experience of the empty state of mind. Actually, emptiness of mind is not even a state of mind, but the original essence of mind which Buddha and the Sixth Patriarch experienced. Essence of mind, original mind, original face, Buddha nature, emptiness all these words mean the absolute calmness of our mind. You know how to rest physically. You do not know how to rest mentally. Even though you lie in your bed your mind is still busy even if you sleep your mind is busy dreaming. Your mind is always in intense activity. This is not so good. We should know how to give up our thinking mind, our busy mind. In order to go beyond our thinking faculty, it is necessary to have a firm conviction in the emptiness of your mind. Believing firmly in the perfect rest of our mind, we should resume our pure original state. Dogenzenji said, You should establish your practice in your delusion. Even though you think you are in delusion, your pure mind is there. To realize pure mind in your delusion is practice. If you have pure mind, essential mind in your delusion, the delusion will vanish. It cannot stay when you say, This is delusion! It will be very much ashamed. It will run away. So you should establish your practice in your delusion. To have delusion is practice. This is to attain enlightenment before you realize it. Even though you do not realize it, you have it. So when you say, This is delusion, that is actually enlightenment itself. If you try to expel the delusion it will only persist the more, and your mind will become busier and busier trying to cope with it. That is not so good. Just say, Oh, this is just delusion, and do not be bothered by it. When you just observe the delusion, you have your true mind, your calm, peaceful mind. When you start to cope with it you will be involved in delusion. So whether or not you attain enlightenment, just to sit in zazen is enough. When you try to attain enlightenment, then you have a big burden on your mind. Your mind will not be clear enough to see things as they are. If you truly see things as they are, then you will see things as they should be. On the one hand, we should attain enlightenment that is how things should be. But on the other hand, as long as we are physical beings, in reality it is pretty hard to attain enlighten ment that is how things actually are in this moment. But if we start to sit, both sides of our nature will be brought up, and we will see things both as they are and as they should be. Because we are not good right now, we want to be better, but when we attain the transcendental mind, we go beyond things as they are and as they should be. In the emptiness of our original mind they are one, and there we find our perfect composure. Usually religion develops itself in the realm of consciousness, seeking to perfect its organization, building beautiful buildings, creating music, evolving a philosophy, and so forth. These are religious activities in the conscious world. But Buddhism emphasizes the world of unconsciousness. The best way to develop Buddhism is to sit in zazen just to sit, with a firm conviction in our true nature. This way is much better than to read books or study the philosophy of Buddhism. Of course it is necessary to study the philosophy it will strengthen your conviction. Buddhist philosophy is so universal and logical that it is not just the philosophy of Buddhism, but of life itself. The purpose of Buddhist teaching is to point to life itself existing beyond consciousness in our pure original mind. All Buddhist practices were built up to protect this true teaching, not to propagate Buddhism in some wonderful mystic way. So when we discuss religion, it should be in the most common and universal way. We should not try to propagate our way by wonderful philosophical thought. In some ways Buddhism is rather polemical, with some feeling of controversy in it, because the Buddhist must protect his way from mystic or magical interpretations of religion. But philosophical discussion will not be the best way to understand Buddhism. If you want to be a sincere Buddhist, the best way is to sit. We are very fortunate to have a place to sit in this way. I want you to have a firm, wide, imperturbable conviction in your zazen of just sitting. lust to sit, that is enough. ' If you take pride in your attainment or become discouraged because of your idealistic effort, your practice will confine you by a thick wall. am very glad to be here on the day Buddha attained enlightenment under the Bo tree. When he attained enlightenment under the Bo tree, he said, It is wonderful to see Buddha nature in everything and in each individual! What he meant was that when we practice zazen we have Buddha nature, and each of us is Buddha himself. By practice he did not mean just to sit under the Bo tree, or to sit in the crosslegged posture. It is true that this posture is the basic one or original way for us, but actually what Buddha meant was that mountains, trees, flowing water, flowers and plants everything as it is is the way Buddha is. It means everything is taking Buddha's activity, each thing in its own way. But the way each thing exists is not to be understood by itself in its own realm of consciousness. What we see or what we hear is just a part, or a limited idea, of what we actually are. But when we just are each just existing in his own way we are expressing Buddha himself. In other words, when we practice something such as azen, then there is Buddha's way or Buddha nature. When we ask what Buddha nature is, it vanishes but when we just practice zazen, we have full understanding of it. The only way to understand Buddha nature is just to practice zazen, just to be here as we are. So what Buddha meant by Buddha nature was to be there as he was, beyond the realm of consciousness. Buddha nature is our original nature we have it before we practice zazen and before we acknowledge it in terms of consciousness. So in this sense, whatever we do is Buddha's activity. If you want to understand it, you cannot understand it. When you give up trying to understand it, true understanding is always there. Usually after zazen give a talk, but the reason people come is not just to listen to my talk, but to practice ' zazen. We should never forget this point. The reason I talk is to encourage you to practice zazen in Buddha's way. So we say that although you have Buddha nature, if you are under the idea of doing or not doing zazen, or if you cannot admit that you are Buddha, then you understand neither Buddha nature nor zazen. But when you practice zazen in the same way as Buddha did, you will understand what our way is. We do not talk so much, but through our activity we communicate with each other, intentionally or unintentionally. We should always be alert enough to communicate with or without words. If this point is lost, we will lose the most important point of Buddhism. Wherever we go, we should not lose this way of life. That is called being Buddha, or being the boss. Wherever you go you should be the master of your surroundings. This means you should not lose your way. So this is called Buddha, because if you exist in this way always, you are Buddha himself. Without trying to be Buddha you are Buddha. This is how we attain enlightenment. To attain enlightenment is to be always with Buddha. By repeating the same thing over and over, we will acquire this kind of understanding. But if you lose this point and take pride in your attainment or become discouraged because of your idealistic effort, your practice will confine you by a thick wall. We should not confine ourselves by a selfbuilt wall. So when zazen time comes, just to get up, to go and sit with your teacher, and to talk to him and listen to him, and then go home again all these procedures are our practice. In this way, without any idea of attainment, you are always Buddha, This is true practice of zazen. Then you may understand the true meaning of Buddha's first statement, ' 'See Buddha nature in various beings, and in every one of us. Z Before the rain stops we can hear l a bird. Even under the heavy snow we see snowdrops and some new growth. Here in America we cannot define Zen Buddhists the same way we do in Japan. American students are not priests and yet not completely laymen. I understand it this way: that you are not priests is an easy matter, but that you are not exactly laymen is more difficult. I think you are special people and want some special practice that is not exactly priest's practice and not exactly laymen's practice. You are on your way to discovering some appropriate way of life. I think that is our Zen community, our group. But we must also know what our undivided original way is and what Dogen's practice is. Dogenzenji said that some may attain enlightenment and some may not. This is a point I am very much interested in. Although we all have the same fundamental practice which we carry out in the same way, some may attain enlightenment and some may not. It means that even if we have no experience of enlightenment, if we sit in the proper way with the right attitude and understanding of practice, then that is Zen. The main point is to practice seriously, and the important attitude is to understand and have confidence in big mind. We say big mind, or small mind, or Buddha mind, or Zen mind, and these words mean something, you know, but something we cannot and should not try to understand in terms of experience. We talk about enlightenment experience, but it is not some experience we will have in terms of good or bad, time or space, past or future. It is experience or consciousness beyond those distinctions or feelings. So we should not ask, What is enlightenment experience That kind ofquestion means you do not know what Zen experience is. Enlightenment cannot be asked for in your ordinary way of thinking. When you are not involved in this way of thinking, you have some chance of understanding what Zen experience is. The big mind in which we must have confidence is not something which you can experience objectively. It is something which is always with you, always on your side. Your eyes are on your side, for you cannot see your eyes, and your eyes cannot see themselves. Eyes only see things outside, objective things. If you reflect on yourself, that self is not your true self any more. You cannot project yourself as some objective thing to think about. The mind which is always on your side is not just your mind, it is universal mind, always the same, not different from another's mind. It is Zen mind. It is big, big mind. This mind is whatever you see. Your true mind is always with whatever you see. Although you do not know your own mind, it is there at the very moment you see something, it is there. This is very interesting. Your mind is always with the things you observe. So you see, this mind is at the same time everything. True mind is watching mind. You cannot say, This is my self, my small mind, or my limited mind, and that is big mind. That is limiting yourself, restricting your true mind, objectifying your mind. Bodhidharma said, In order to see a fish you must watch the water. Actually when you see water you see the true fish. Before you see Buddha nature you watch your mind. When you see the water there is true nature. True nature is watching water. When you say, My zazen is very poor, here you have true nature, but foolishly you do not realize it. You ignore it on purpose. There is immense importance in the I with which you watch your mind. That I is not the big I it is the I which is incessantly active, always swimming, always flying through the vast air with wings. By wings I mean thought and activity. The vast sky is home, my home. There is no bird or air. When the fish swims, water and fish are the fish. There is nothing but fish. Do you understand You cannot find Buddha nature by vivisection. Reality cannot be caught by thinking or feeling mind. Moment after moment to watch your breathing, to watch your posture, is true nature. There is no secret beyond this point. We Buddhists do not have any idea of material only, or mind only, or the products of our mind, or mind as an attribute ofbeing. What we are always talking about is that mind and body, mind and material are always one. But if you listen carelessly it sounds as if we are talking about some attribute ofbeing, or about material or spiritual. That will be a version of it, maybe. But actually we are pointing out mind which is always on this side, which is true mind. Enlightenment experience is to figure out, to understand, to realize this mind which is always with us and which we cannot see. Do you understand If you try to attain enlightenment as if you see a bright star in the sky, it will be beautiful and you may think, Ah, this is enlightenment, but that is not enlightenment. That understanding is literally heresy. Even though you do not know it, in that understanding you have the idea of material only. Dozens of your enlightenment experiences are like that some material only, some object of your mind, as if through good practice you found that bright star. That is the idea of self and object. It is not the way to seek for enlightenment. The Zen school is based on our actual nature, on our true mind as expressed and realized in practice. Zen does not depend on a particular teaching nor does it substitute teaching for practice. We practice zazen to express our true nature, not to attain enlightenment. Bodhidharma's Buddhism is to be practice, to be enlightenment. At first this may be a kind of belief, but later it is something the student feels or already has. Physical practice and rules are not so easy to understand, maybe especially for Americans. You have an idea of freedom which concentrates on physical freedom, on freedom of activity. This idea causes you some mental suffering and loss of freedom. You think you want to limit your thinking, you think some of your thinking is unnecessary or painful or en tangling but you do not think you want to limit your physical activity. For this reason Hyakujo established the rules and way of Zen life in China. He was interested in expressing and transmitting the freedom of true mind. Zen mind is transmitted in our Zen way of life based on Hyakujo's rules. I think we naturally need some way of life as a group and as Zen students in America, and as Hyakujo established our way of monastic life in China, I think we must establish an American way of Zen life. I am not saying this jokingly. I am pretty serious. But I do not want to be too serious. If we become too serious we will lose our way. If we are playing games we will lose our way. Little by little with patience and endurance we must find the way for ourselves, find out how to live with ourselves and with each other. In this way we will find out our precepts. If we practice hard, concentrate on zazen, and organize our life so that we can sit well, we will find out what we are doing. But you have to be careful in the rules and way you establish. If it is too strict you will fail, if it is too loose, the rules will not work. Our way should be strict enough to have authority, an authority everyone should obey. The rules should be possible to observe. This is how Zen tradition was built up, decided little by little, created by us in our practice. We cannot force anything. But once the rules have been decided, we should obey them completely until they are changed. It is not a matter of good or bad, convenient or inconvenient. You just do it without question. That way your mind is free. The important thing is to obey your rules without discrimination. This way you will know the pure Zen mind. To have our own way of life means to encourage people to have a more spiritual and adequate way of life as human beings. And I think one day you will have your own practice in America. The only way to study pure mind is through practice. Our inmost nature wants some medium, some way to express and realize itself. We answer this inmost request through our rules, and Patriarch after Patriarch shows us his true mind. In this way we will have an accurate, deep understanding of practice. We must have more experience of our practice. At least we must have some enlightenment experience. You must put confidence in the big mind which is always with you. You should be able to appreciate things as an expression of big mind. This is more than faith. This is ultimate truth which you cannot reject. Whether it is difficult or easy to practice, difficult or easy to understand, you can only practice it. Priest or layman is not the point. To find yourself as someone who is doing something is the point to resume your actual being through practice, to resume the you which is always with everything, with Buddha, which is fully supported by everything. Right now! You may say it is impossible. But it is possible! Even in one moment you can do it! It is possible this moment! It is this moment! That you can do it in this moment means you can always do it. So if you have this confidence. this is your enlightenment experience. If you have this strong confidence in your big mind, you are already a Buddhist in the true sense, even though you do not attain enlightenment. That is why Dogenzenji said, Do not expect that all who practice zazen will attain enlightenment about this mind which is always with us. He meant if you think that big mind is somewhere outside yourself, outside of your practice, then that is a mistake. Big mind is always with us. That is why I repeat the same thing over and over when I think you do not understand. Zen is not just for the man who can fold his legs or who has great spiritual ability. Everyone has Buddha nature. We each must find some way to realize our true nature. The purpose of practice is to have direct experience of the Buddha nature which everyone has. Whatever you do should be the direct experience of Buddha nature. Buddha nature means to be aware of Buddha nature. Your effort should extend to saving all sentient beings. If my words are not good enough. 'll hit you! Then you will understand what I mean. And if you do not understand me just now, someday you will. Some day someone will understand. I will wait for the island I was told is moving slowly up the coast from Los Angeles to Seattle. I feel Americans, especially young Americans, have a great opportunity to find out the true way of life for human beings. You are quite free from material things and you begin Zen practice with a very pure mind, a beginner's mind. You can understand Buddha's teaching exactly as he meant it. But we must not be attached to America, or Buddhism, or even to our practice. We must have beginner's mind, free from possessing anything, a mind that knows everything is in flowing change. Nothing exists but momentarily in its present form and color. One thing flows into another and cannot be grasped. Before the rain stops we hear a bird. Even under the heavy snow we see snowdrops and some new growth. In the East I saw rhubarb already. In Japan in the spring we eat cucumbers.Sekito Kisen Ch. Shitou Xiqian, , author of the Sandokai, was born in Guangdong Province in southern China in the beginning of the eighth century. This was a formative era in which Zen was growing in popularity and was first articulated as a unique school and lineage. Questions about the nature and origins of Zen and the earliest surviving accounts of the First Chinese Zen Ancestor, Bodhidharma c. , date from this time. It was also during this period that Zen became known for its emphasis on the direct experience of reality and the practice of seated meditation. But sectarian disputes arose between the Northern school of Zen, which taught a doctrine of gradual, stepladder practice, and the Southern school, which taught that attaining enlightenment is sudden and immediate. Debates flourished over which lineage was superior. From todays perspective, the differences between the two schools seem exaggerated, as both schools emphasized sudden attainment as well as constant cultivation, primarily through Sekito Kisen and the Sandokaiseated meditation. Indeed, the Northern school originally was very popular and influential, but after several generations its influence and identity as a separate school faded. Not much is known about Sekitos life. The first recorded event is an encounter, at the age of twelve, with the Sixth Ancestor, Daikan Eno Ch. Dajian Huineng, . When the precocious youth approached Eno, the master jokingly said, If you become my disciple youll start to look ugly like me. Sekito smiled and said, Fine. Two years later he was one of the disciples present at Enos deathbed. Sekito seems to have practiced basically alone for the next fifteen years, after which he settled down to study with one of Enos main disciples, Seigen Gyoshi Ch. Qingyuan Xingsi, . After their first dialogue, Seigen said of his new disciple: I have many horned animals in my assembly. One unicorn is all I need. In , Sekito built a hut on a large stone ledge on Mount Heng in what is now Hunan Province. His name Sekito, stone head, derives from his sitting zazen on this stone ledge. Eihei Dogen, who brought Soto Zen to Japan five centuries later, wrote the following about Sekito:Great Master Shitou Sekito did zazen on a large rock where he had a thatched hut. He sat continuously without sleeping day or night. Although he did not ignore work, he did not fail to do zazen throughout the day. Nowadays the descendants of his teacher Qingyuan Seigen are spread throughout China, benefiting humans and devas. This is all due to the solid continuous practice and the great determination of Shitou Sekito.Sekito Kisen and the Sandokai Several exchanges between Sekito and students have been preserved. In one such encounter, Sekitos disciple Tenno Dogo Ch. Tianhuang Daowu, asked his teacher who was the rightful heir of the Sixth Ancestor.Who obtained the essential teaching of the Sixth Ancestor Sekito replied: He who understands buddha dharma obtained it.Did you obtain it Dogo asked.I dont understand buddha dharma, Sekito replied. On another occasion a monk asked Sekito: How does one get emancipationSekito: Who has put you in bondageMonk: What is the Pure LandSekito: Who has defiled youMonk: What is nirvanaSekito: Who has placed you in birthanddeathIt was said that a monk remained ignorant unless he visited both South of the Lake with Master Sekito and West of the River with Master Baso Ch. Mazu, . The five schools of Zen developed from these two great teachers who, during their time, truly embodied the way of Zen. While there is no record of them having met in person, each sent his students to study with the other. Here is an example of the way they interacted with Yakusan Igen Ch. Yaoshan Weiyan, , who later became one of Sekitos successors. Yakusan visited Sekito and asked Sekito Kisen and the Sandokaihim: I understand the scriptural teachings of Buddhism, but I hear that in the south they Zen practitioners directly point to the human mind. They see their natures and become buddhas. This is still not clear to me. I humbly ask you to explain it. Sekito said: This way wont do and not this way wont do, and both this way and not this way wont do. How about youYakusan was dumbfounded.Sekito said: You should go see Baso. So Yakusan paid his respects to Baso and asked the same question. Baso said: Sometimes I make him raise his eyebrows and blink, sometimes I do not make him raise his eyebrows and blink. Sometimes raising the eyebrows and blinking is all right, sometimes raising the eyebrows and blinking is not all right. How about you Hearing these words, Yakusan was greatly awakened, and he bowed. Baso asked: What truth have you seen that makes you bow Yakusan replied: When I was with Sekito, it was like a mosquito climbing on an iron ox. Baso said: Since you have realized the truth, you must guard it well. But still, your master is Sekito. Another exchange between Sekito and Yakusan demonstrates a true meeting of teacher and student. One day, seeing Yakusan sitting zazen, Sekito asked him: What are you doing here Sekito Kisen and the SandokaiYakusan answered: Im not doing anything at all.Sekito said: In that case, you are sitting idly. Yakusan replied: If I were sitting idly, then I would be doing something. Sekito asked: You say you are not doing anything. What is this not doingYakusan replied: Not even the ten thousand sages know.The Sandokai Ch. Cantongqi addresses the division between the Northern and Southern schools as well as other dichotomies such as one and many, light and dark, sameness and difference. In todays scientific climate, Sekito might well have written of wave and particle. Made up of twentytwo couplets fortyfour lines, the poem often follows a pattern of distinguishing first discontinuity, then continuity, and finally complementarity. An earlier Daoist text on the Yijing bore the title Sandokai, and Sekitos poem alludes to Daoist themes of nature and change. It also shows the influence of Kegon philosophy the Huayen or Flower Garland school of Buddhism, which teaches the equality of all things and the dependence of all things on one another. The importance of the Sandokai to the Soto Zen lineage is clearly of the first order. The poem is chanted every day in Soto Zen temples throughout the world, and almost always when a memorial service is held for the founder of a temple. Sekito Kisen and the SandokaiThree generations after Sekito, Tozan Ryokai Ch. Dongshan Liangjie, wrote the Hokyo Zammai Ch. Baojing Sanmei, which developed ideas from the Sandokai. The teaching of the five ranks also grew out of the Sandokai. I conclude with the last couplet of the Sandokai, the sentiments of which are often written on the han, the wooden board struck to announce meditation in Zen temples and monasteries: I respectfully urge you who study the mystery, do not pass your days and nights in vain. n o t e s t o t h e r e a d e rSuzuki Roshi used several English translations of the Sandokai that were available at that timemainly those by . . Blyth and Reiho Masunagaand he translated directly from the Chinese characters as well. So his commentary does not fit with or match any one translation exactly. We have included in this text page the English translation from the SotoShu SotoSchool Liturgy Conference held at Green Gulch Farm, Sausalito, California in , with some revisions. We have also found no perfect translation for the title of the Sandokai. The title proposed by the SotoShu Liturgy Conference is The Harmony of Dierence and Equality.The problems inherent in any translation of such a profound work bring to mind a line from the Hokyo Zammai: The meaning is not in the words, but it responds to the inquiring impulse. Although Suzuki Roshi did not compose his own complete translation of the Sandokai, in these talks he did oer an ongoing characterbycharacter translation of the poem.We have sifted through these talks as well as sources not included in Notes to the Readerthe present work e.g., private discussions with students and created a composite English version of the Sandokai, to be found at the back of this book. Suzuki Roshi oered more than one translation of some characters and phrases, depending on the context of his talk, so our composite version must remain only an approximation of what Suzuki Roshi might have written. Chinese teachers mentioned in this book are introduced with the Japanese equivalents of their Chinese names, followed by the original Chinese names in parentheses. Chinese characters have been romanized using the pinyin system. Thus, the name of the author of the poem, Sekito Kisen, is Shitou Xiqian using the pinyin system. The earlier WadeGiles system would have given his name as Shihtou Hsichien. To help the reader keep track of the various teachers and lineages mentioned in the text, we have included a lineage chart at the back of the book. The romanized Japanese transliteration of the Sandokai on page was kindly and expertly provided by Kazuaki Tanahashi. The Chinese version of the Sandokai, also on page , is reproduced from Taisho shinshu daizokyo, an edition of the complete SinoJapanese Buddhist canon, edited by Junjiro Takakusu and Kaigyoku Watanabe. For ease of reading, we have opted to remove macrons longvowel accent marks from most Japanese terms in the body of the text. However, we have preserved them in the full Japanese version of the poem on page , in the lineage chart, and in bibliographic citations. The mind of the great sage of Indiais intimately transmitted from west to east.I am very grateful for this opportunity to talk about the Sandokai, one of our most important teachings. Its mode of expression is so smooth that you may not feel its deep meaning when you read it. The author of this poem, Sekito Kisen or Sekito Musai Daishin, his posthumous name, is the dharma grandson of the Sixth Chinese Ancestor, Daikan Eno in Chinese, Dajian Huineng, and the direct descendent of Seigen Gyoshi Ch. Qingyuan Xingsi, who is considered the Seventh Ancestor. Among the Sixth Ancestors many disciples, the most prominent were Seigen Gyoshi and Nangaku Ejo. Later, Master Tozan Ryokai continued Seigens lineage as the Soto school, and Master Rinzai Gigen Ch. Linji Yixuan continued Nangakus lineage as the Rinzai school. Soto and Rinzai eventually became the dominant schools of Zen. The way of Seigen and Sekito has a more gentle quality than Nangakus way. In Japan we call this the elder brothers way. Nangaku is more like the second or third son, who is often rather naughty. The elder brother may not be so able or so First Talkbright, but he is very gentle. This is our understanding when we talk about Soto and Rinzai. Sometimes Soto Zen is called memmitsu no kafua very careful and considerate style. Seigens way is to find everything within himself. It is to realize the great mind that includes everything and to practice accordingly. Our effort in Zen is to observe everything asitis. Yet even though we say so, we are not necessarily observing everything asitis. We say, Here is my friend, over there is the mountain, and way up there is the moon. But your friend is not only your friend, the mountain is not only the mountain, and the moon is not only the moon. If we think, I am here and the mountain is over there, that is a dualistic way of observing things. To go to San Francisco, we have to cross over the Tassajara mountains. That is our usual understanding. But that is not the Buddhist way of observing things. We find the mountain or the moon or our friend or San Francisco within ourselves. Right here. That is big mind within which everything exists. Now, lets look at the title, Sandokai. San literally means three, but here it means things. Do is sameness. To identify one thing with another is do. It also refers to oneness or ones whole being, which here means great mind or big mind. So our understanding is that there is one whole being that includes everything, and that the many things are found in one whole being. Although we say many beings, they are actually the many parts of one whole being that includes everything. If you say many it is many, and if you say one it is one. Many and one are dierent ways of ThingsAsItIsdescribing one whole being. To completely understand the relationship between one great whole being and the many facets of that one great whole being is kai. Kai means to shake hands. You have a feeling of friendship. You feel that the two of you are one. In the same way, this one great whole being and the many things are good friends, or more than good friends because they are originally one. Therefore like shaking hands we say kai. Hi, how are you This is the meaning of the poems title. What is many What is one And what is the oneness of one and many Originally, Sandokai was the title of a Daoist book. Sekito used the same title for his poem, which describes Buddhas teaching. What is the difference between Daoist teachings and Buddhist teachings There are many similarities. When a Buddhist reads it, it is a Buddhist text, and when a Daoist reads it, it is a Daoist text. Yet it is actually the same thing. When a Buddhist eats a vegetable it is Buddhist food, and when a vegetarian eats it, it is vegetarian food. Still it is just food. As Buddhists, we do not eat a particular vegetable just because it has some special nourishing quality, or choose it because it is yin or yang, acid or alkaline. Simply to eat food is our practice. We dont eat just to support ourselves. As we say in our meal chant, To practice our way, we eat this food. This is how big mind is included in our practice. To think this is just a vegetable is not our understanding. We must treat things as part of ourselves, within our practice and within big mind. Small mind is the mind that is under the limitation of desires or some particular emotional covering or the discrimination of good and bad. So, for the most part, even though First Talkwe think we are observing thingsasitis, actually we are not. Why Because of our discrimination, or our desires. The Buddhist way is to try hard to let go of this kind of emotional discrimination of good and bad, to let go of our prejudices, and to see thingsasitis. When I say to see thingsasitis, what I mean is to practice hard with our desiresnot to get rid of desires, but to take them into account. If you have a computer, you must enter all the data: this much desire, this much nourishment, this kind of color, this much weight. We must include our desires as one of the many factors in order to see thingsasitis. We dont always reflect on our desires. Without stopping to reflect on our selfish judgment we say He is good or He is bad. But someone who is bad to me is not necessarily always bad. To someone else, he may be a good person. Reflecting in this way we can see thingsasitis. This is buddha mind. The poem begins Chikudo daisen no shin, which means the mind of the great sage of India. That is Buddhas big mind that includes everything. The mind we have when we practice zazen is the great mind: We dont try to see anything we stop conceptual thinking we stop emotional activity we just sit. Whatever happens to us, we are not bothered. We just sit. It is like something happening in the great sky. Whatever kind of bird flies through it, the sky doesnt care. That is the mind transmitted from Buddha to us. Many things happen as you sit. You may hear the sound of the stream. You may think of something, but your mind doesnt care. Your great mind is just there sitting. Even when ThingsAsItIsyou are not aware of seeing, hearing, or thinking, something is going on in big mind. We observe things. Without saying good or bad, we just sit. We enjoy things but have no special attachment to them. We have full appreciation of them at this time, thats all. After zazen we say, Oh, good morning! In that way, one after another, things will happen to us and we can fully appreciate them. That is the mind transmitted from Buddha. And that is the way we practice zazen. If you practice zazen in this way, you are less likely to have trouble when you are enjoying some event. Do you understand You may have a special experience and think, This is it. This is how it should be. If someone opposes you, you will be angry. No, it should be like this, not like that. Zen Center should be like this. Maybe so. But it is not always so. If times change and we lose Tassajara and move to another mountain, the way we have here cannot be the same way we will have there. So, without sticking to some particular way, we open our minds to observe thingsasitis and to accept thingsasitis. Without this basis, when you say this is the mountain, or this is my friend, or this is the moon, the mountain will not be the mountain, my friend will not be my friend, and the moon will not be the moon itself. That is the difference between sticking to something and Buddhas way. Buddhas way is the study and teaching of human nature, including how foolish we are, what kinds of desires we have, our preferences and tendencies. Without sticking to something, I try to remember to use the expression liable to. We are liable to, or we have a tendency to do something. This is my motto. First Talk When I was preparing this lecture someone asked me, What is selfrespect, and how can we obtain it Selfrespect is not something that you can feel you have. When you feel I have selfrespect, that is not selfrespect anymore. When you are just you, without thinking or trying to say something special, just saying what is on your mind and how you feel, then there is naturally selfrespect. When I am closely related to all of you and to everything, then I am a part of one big whole being. When I feel something, Im almost a part of it, but not quite. When you do something without any feeling of having done something, then that is you, yourself. Youre completely with everyone and you dont feel selfconscious. That is selfrespect.When you feel that you are somebody, you have to practice zazen harder. As you know, it is dicult to sit without thinking or feeling. When you dont think or feel, you usually fall asleep. But without sleeping and without thinking, just to be yourself is our practice. When you can do that, you will be able to speak without thinking too much, and without having any special purpose. When you speak or act it will be just to express yourself. That is complete selfrespect. To practice zazen is to attain this kind of selfrespect. You must be strict with yourself and especially with your tendencies. We each have our own unique personal tendencies. But if you try to get rid of them, or if you try not to think or not to hear the sound of the stream during zazen, it is not possible. Let your ears hear without trying to hear. Let the mind think without trying to think and without trying to stop it. That is practice. More and more, you will have this rhythm or strength asThingsAsItIsthe power of practice. If you practice hard you will be like a child. While we were talking about selfrespect a bird was singing outside. Peeppeeppeep. Thats selfrespect. Peeppeeppeep. It doesnt mean anything. Maybe he was just singing. Maybe without trying to think he was just singing, peeppeeppeep. When we heard it we couldnt stop smiling. We cannot say that it is just a bird. It controls the whole mountain, the whole world. That is selfrespect. In order to have this everyday practice, we study hard. When we reach this place, there is no need to say one whole being or bird or many things which include one whole being. It could be just a bird or a mountain or the Sandokai. If you understand this, there will be no need to recite the Sandokai. Although we recite it in this JapaneseChinese form, it is not a matter of Japanese or Chinese. It is just a poem, or a bird, and this is just my talk. It does not mean much. We say that Zen is not something to talk about. It is what you experience in a true sense. It is dicult. But anyway this is a dicult world, so dont worry. Wherever you go you have problems. You should confront your problems. It may be much better to have these problems of practice rather than some other mixedup kinds of problems.d i s c u s s i o nStudent: The other day when I was beating the mokugyo, a small spider crawled across the top of it. There was nothing A wooden drum struck to provide a rhythm for chanting.First TalkI could do to avoid the spider. I veered a little o to the side to avoid him, but he went right into the striker. It was too powerful for him to escape.Suzuki Roshi: You didnt kill him.Student: Something did! Laughter.Suzuki Roshi: By mistake. It happened in that way.Student: Yeah, but I couldnt stop.Suzuki Roshi: Yeah. You know, it cant be helped. Buddha killed him! Laughter. He may be very happy. To live in this world is not so easy. When you see children playing by a stream or on a bridge, you may be really worried. The cars are going zoom, zoom, zoom on the highway nearby. What if there is an accident If something happens, thats all. If you stop and think, you will be terrified. Did you hear about the year old man who has more than two hundred children, grandchildren, and greatgrandchildren If he thought about each one of them, he would be scared of losing one. Our practice can be a very strict practice. You should be ready to kill something even if you are a Buddhist. Whether it is good or bad, you should do that sometime. It is impossible to survive without killing anything. We cannot live depending just on our feelings. Our practice must be deeper than that. That is the strict side of our practice. On the other hand, if it is absolutely necessary, you should stop hitting the mokugyo even though it throws everything into confusion. Not so easy. ThingsAsItIsStudent: Would you explain more what you mean by strict practiceSuzuki Roshi: Strict practice Things are already going in a very strict way. There is no exception. Wherever there is something, there is some rule or truth behind it that is always strictly controlling it, without any exception. We think we care for freedom, but the other side of freedom is strict rule. Within the strict rule there is complete freedom. Freedom and strict rule are not two separate things. Originally we are supported by strict rules or truths. That is the other side of absolute freedom.Student: Could you give us more examples that apply to our individual livesSuzuki Roshi: When you get up you should just get up. When everyone sleeps you should sleep. That is my example.Student: My responsibility is such that its very easy for me to follow the strict way, because it goes with my position. Other people have somewhat dierent responsibilities. Sometimes, because my inclination is to follow strictly, we have some differences, and sometimes I think its okay for them to do things dierently than I do. Is that rightSuzuki Roshi: Yeah. Sometimes you should shut your eyes.First TalkLaughing. Sometimes it may be unfortunate to see something. If you see it, you have to say something, so it may help you to practice without looking around. That is the best way, actually. If you look around, then, if you see the people on this side of the zendo, the people on the other side will sleep. So its better not to see anything! Laughter. They wont know what you are doing. He may not be sleeping, so all of us will stay awake. If you see something, thats all. The rest will be ignored. If you dont see anything, you cannot ignore anything. That is the big mind that includes everything. If someone moves, you will notice. Even though you dont try to hear it, if some sound comes you will catch it. If you focus on one person, the rest of the people will be very happy! Laughter. If you dont catch anyone, no one can move.s e c o n d t a l kWarm Hand to Warm HandThe mind of the great sage of Indiais intimately transmitted from west to east.While human faculties are sharp or dull,the way has no Northern or Southern Ancestors.In my first talk I explained the meaning of the title, Sandokai, and the first line, The mind of the great sage of India. I would like to tell you about the background of this poem and why the Eighth Ancestor in China, Sekito Musai Daishin, wrote it. When Daiman Konin, the Fifth Ancestor, announced that he was going to give dharma transmission to someone, all the monks thought that, among them, of course Jinshu would be the one to receive the transmission. Jinshu was a great scholar, and he later went to northern China and became a great teacher. But actually Eno, who was pounding rice in the corner of the temple, received the transmission and became the Sixth Ancestor. Jinshus school was called Hoku Zen, or Northern Zen, and Enos school spread to the south and was called Nan Zen, or Southern Zen. Later, after Jinshus death, Northern Zen became weaker while Southern Zen became stronger. But in Sekitos time Northern Zen was still powerful.The Sixth Ancestor, Eno, had many disciples. We can countSecond Talkfifty, but there must have been more. The youngest was Kataku Jinne Ch. Heze Shenhui, a very alert and active person who denounced Jinshus Zen pretty strongly. We cannot completely accept his teaching. If you have studied the Platform Sutra of the Sixth Ancestor, you know that Jinshus teaching is harshly denounced there. The sutra may have been compiled by someone under the influence of Kataku Jinne. Anyway, there was some conflict between Enos Southern Zen and Jinshus Northern Zen. Sekito wanted to clarify this dispute from his own viewpoint. This is why he wrote the Sandokai. The poem begins, The mind of the great sage of India is intimately transmitted from west to east. Sekitos understanding is that the true teaching of the great sage, Shakyamuni Buddha, includes both the Southern school and the Northern school without any contradiction. Although the teaching of the great sage may not be completely understood, still it reaches everywhere. If you have the eyes to see or the mind to understand the teaching, you will see that it is not necessary to be involved in such a dispute. Because some of the descendants of Eno and Jinshu didnt completely understand the teaching of Buddha they got into a dispute. From Sekitos point of view there is no need for contention. Is intimately transmitted. Mitsuni literally means exactly, without a gap between the two. The main purpose of the Sandokai is to explain reality from two sides. As I said, san means many do means one. What is many What is one Many are one one is many. Even though you say many, the many Warm Hand to Warm Handthings do not exist separately from each other. They are closely related. If so, they are one. But even though they are one, the one appears to be many. So many is right, and one is right. Even though we say one, we cannot ignore the various beings like stars and moons, animals and fish. From this point of view we say that they are interdependent. When we discuss the meaning of each being, we may have many things to discuss. When we conclude that reality is in fact just oneness, the whole discussion will take place in this understanding of the unity of one and many. Another way to explain reality is by dierentiation. Differentiation is equality, and things have equal value because they are dierent. If men and women are the same, then the distinctions between men and women have no value. Because men and women are dierent, men are valuable as men and women are valuable as women. To be dierent is to have value. In this sense all things have equal, absolute value. Each thing has absolute value and thus is equal to everything else. We are normally involved with standards of evaluation: exchange value, material value, spiritual value, and moral value. Because you have some standard you can say he is good or he is not so good. The moral standard defines the value of people. But the moral standard is always changing a virtuous person is not always virtuous. If you compare him with someone like Buddha, he is not so good. Good or bad is arrived at by some standard of evaluation. But because each thing is different, each thing has its own value. That value is absolute. The mountain is not more valuable because it is high the river Second Talkis not less valuable because it is low. On the other hand, because a mountain is high, it is a mountain, and it has absolute value because water runs low in the valley, water is water and it has absolute value. The quality of the mountain and the quality of the river are completely dierent because they are dierent they have equal value and equal value means absolute value. According to Buddhism equality is dierentiation, and differentiation is equality. The usual understanding is that differentiation is the opposite of equality, but our understanding is that they are the same thing. One and many are the same. If you only see from the perspective that says one is dierent from many, your understanding is too materialistic and superficial. The next line is While human faculties are sharp or dull. It is dicult to translate this passage. It refers to the dispute between the Northern school and the Southern school. The clever ones do not always have an advantage in studying or accepting Buddhism, and it is not always the dull person who has difficulty. A dull person is good because he is dull a sharp person is good because he is sharp. Even though you compare, you cannot say which is best. I am not so sharp, so I understand this pretty well. My master Gyokujun Soon always addressed me as You crooked cucumber! I was his last disciple, but I became the first one because all the good cucumbers ran away. Maybe they were too smart. Anyway, I was not smart enough to run away so I was caught. For studying Buddhism my dullness was an ad Warm Hand to Warm Handvantage. When all the others went away and I was left alone with my master, I was very sad. If I had been a smart fellow I would have run away too. But I had left home by my own choice. My parents said, You are too young. You should stay here. But I had to go. After leaving my parents, I felt I couldnt go back home. I could have, but I thought I couldnt. So I had nowhere to go. That is one reason why I didnt run away. Another reason was that I wasnt smart enough. A smart person does not always have the advantage, and a dull person is good because he is dull. This is our understanding. Actually there is no dull person or smart person. Either way it is not so easy. There is some difficulty for both the smart person and the dull person. For instance, because he is not so smart, the dull person must study hard and read one book over and over again. A smart person forgets quite easily. He may learn quickly, but what he learns may not stay so long. For the dull person, it takes time to remember something, but if he reads it over and over and remembers it, it will not go away so soon. Smart or dull may not make so much difference. While human faculties are sharp or dullNinkon ni ridon ari. In the Sandokai this point is not so important, but it is interesting to understand what human potentiality is in Buddhism in order to explain further our understanding of practice and why it is necessary to practice zazen. Nin is human, kon is root or potentiality so ninkon is human potentiality. Ri here means someone who has an advantage, and don means someone who has a disadvantage. So the root of human potentiality is our advantage as well as disadvantage. Second Talk The capacity of the human mind has three aspects: potentiality, interrelationship, and appropriateness. We have the potentiality to be a buddha. It is like a bow and arrow. Because a bow and arrow have potentiality, if you use them the arrow will fly. If you dont use them the arrow wont fly. You are ready to be a buddha, but if you dont practice zazen, or Buddha doesnt help you, you cannot be a buddha even though you have potentiality. Potentiality has two meanings. One is possibility. From the viewpoint of our nature, we have the possibility to be buddhas. On the other hand, if you observe me in terms of time, even though I have the potentiality, if someone doesnt help me I cannot be a buddha. From the viewpoint of time, potentiality means something like future possibility. This is the other meaning. When we understand potentiality in terms of nature, we should be very kind and generous to everyone because everyone naturally has the possibility to be a buddha. But when we think in terms of when, we should be very strict. Do you understand If you miss this time, if you do not make a good effort this week or this year, if you always say tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, you will miss a chance to attain enlightenment, even though you have the possibility. It is the same with your practice. When you dont think about time, you can be very generous with everyone, you can treat people very well. But if you think about time, about today and tomorrow, you cannot be so generous because you will lose time. So we say, You do this and I will do that, and Warm Hand to Warm HandYou help this person and I will help that person. In this way we should be very strict with ourselves. That is why we analyze ki, potentiality, as both possibility and future possibility. When you understand potentiality in this way, you can work and practice very well, sometimes in a very generous way and sometimes in a very strict way. We have to have two sides to our practice, or to our understanding of ki. This is the first meaning of kipotentiality. Ki also means interrelationshiphere, the interrelationship between a buddha and someone with a good nature, and between a buddha and someone with a bad nature. I am sorry to say bad nature, but tentatively I must use those words. We should encourage people who have a good nature, giving them some joy of practice. And when we practice with someone who apparently is not so good, we should suffer with that person. That is our understanding. So ki sometimes means the interrelationship between someone who helps and someone who is helped. This is also called jihi. Ji here means to encourage someone. Hi means to give happiness. Jihi is usually translated love. Love has two sides. One is to give joy, yoraku, and the other is to lessen suffering, bakku. To lessen someones suffering we suffer with them, we share their suffering. That is love. So if someone is very good, we can share the joy of practice with them by giving them a good cushion, a good zendo, or something like that. But a zendo doesnt mean anything to someone who is suffering too much whatever you give may not be accepted. Someone may say, I dont need it. Im suf Second Talkfering too much. I dont know why. Right now to get out of the suffering is the most important thing for me. You cant help me, nothing can help me. When you hear this, you should be like Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattvayou should become like the one who is suffering, and you should suffer as that person suffers. Because of your innate love, your instinctive love, you share the suffering. That is love in its true sense. So ki may mean not only potentiality or possibility, but also interrelationship. The third meaning of ki is good means or appropriate use, like finding the right cover for a pot. The traditional Japanese bath is a wooden tub, and after finishing our bath we cover it with a big wooden lid. That cover cannot be used for a pot. It is too big. So the pot must have its own cover. In this sense ki means appropriate use. If you see people who are suffering because of ignorance, because they dont know what they are doing, you weep, you suffer with them. When you see people who enjoy their true nature, you should share their joy and give them encouragement. This is to have a good, appropriate relationship. Next the poem says, The way has no Northern or Southern Ancestors. That is very true. Jinshus teaching is good, and the Sixth Ancestor Enos teaching is good. Jinshus way is good for someone who studies things slowly and deliberately, and the Sixth Ancestors way is good for a quick, sharpminded person. One teacher may explain Buddhas teaching in detail so that the student can understand it word for word. But for another student it is not necessary to make the point Warm Hand to Warm Handusing so many words. It depends on the person. A great teachers way of explaining the teaching will be unique. But there is no difference in true understanding. People become confused because of the way they evaluate things, discriminating between the dull and the keen but from the standpoint of the Ancestors they are the same. All the Ancestors understood this point. So there is no Northern Ancestor or Southern Ancestor. That is Sekitos understanding. By the way, Sekito was actually the Sixth Ancestors disciple, but after the Sixth Ancestor passed away, Sekito became the disciple of Seigen, the Seventh Ancestor. That kind of thing happens very often. I have some disciples here, but if I die, those who couldnt complete their training as my disciples will be disciples of my disciples. Studying Buddhism is not like studying other things. It may take time before you can accept the teaching completely. The most important factor is you yourself, rather than your teacher. When you study hard, what you receive from your teacher is the spirit of study. That spirit will be transmitted from warm hand to warm hand. You should do it! Thats all. There is nothing to transmit to you. And what you learn may be from books or from other teachers, so that is why we have other teachers as well as a master. Some of you are my disciples. We call a masters disciples deshi. Those of you who are not my disciples are called zuishin. A zuishin is a follower. One may stay quite a long time under some teacher, sometimes longer than the period one stays with ones master. When I was thirtytwo my master passed away, so after that I studied under Kishizawa Roshi, Second Talkand most of the understanding I have is from Kishizawa Roshi. But my master was Gyokujun Soon. Anyway, the true way has no Ancestor of North of South. The true way is one. To practice is not to collect things and put them in your basket, but rather to find something in your sleeve. Its just that before you study hard, you dont know what you have in your sleeve. Buddha and I have the same thing. Oh! Thats amazing! That is the spirit we must have. No matter what I say you should study hard. If you dont like what I say, you shouldnt accept it. That is okay. Eventually you may accept it. If you say, No! I will say, Okay, but go ahead and try hard! I think that is the characteristic of Buddhism. Our approach is very wide, and as a Buddhist you have enormous freedom in your study. Whatever you say is okay. So there is no Ancestor of South or North.d i s c u s s i o nStudent: Roshi, couldnt we just work from the Japanese and forget the English translationSuzuki Roshi: Yes. I am trying hard to follow the order of the characters. If you translate the poem into fluent English, I may find it dicult to explain. The original poem is full of technical terms, and you cannot change that. If you try to change it, you will lose something and it will not make much sense. Because I want you to understand completely I want to follow the original text faithfully, even though it is dicult.t h i r d t a l kBuddha Is Always HereThe spiritual source shines clear in the lightthe branching streams flow on in the dark.Grasping at things is surely delusionaccording with sameness is still not enlightenment.The spiritual source shines clear in the light. The source is something wonderful, something beyond description, beyond our words. What Buddha talked about is the source of the teaching, beyond discrimination of right and wrong. This is important. Whatever your mind can conceive is not the source itself. The source is something that only a buddha knows. Only when you practice zazen do you have it. Yet whether you practice or not, whether you realize it or not, something exists, even before our realization of it, that is the source. It is not something you can taste. The true source is neither tasty nor tasteless. In the last of these four lines Sekito says, According with sameness is still not enlightenment. So to recognize the truth is not enlightenment either. Often we feel that the truth is something we should be able to see or figure out. But in Buddhism that is not the truth. The truth is something beyond our ability to describe, beyond our thinking. Truth can also mean the wonderful source, wonderful beyond our description. This is the source of all being.By the way, when we say being, being includes ourThird Talkthoughts as well as the many things we see. Usually when we say truth, we mean some underlying principle. That the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, or that the earth turns in a certain direction is truth. But in Buddhism that is not ultimate truth it is also being, being that is included in big mind. Whatever is in our mindbig or small, right or wrongthat is being. If you think about something in terms of right or wrong you may say, This is eternal truth. But for us that idea of eternal truth is also on the side of being, because it exists simply in our mind. We do not make much distinction between things that exist outside and things that exist within ourselves. You may say something exists outside of yourself, you may feel that it does, but it isnt true. When you say, There is the river, the river is already in your mind. A hasty person may say, The river is over there, but if you think more about it you will find that the river is in your mind as a kind of thought. That things exist outside of ourselves is a dualistic, primitive, shallow understanding of things. So the characters of the first line, Reigen myoni kokettari, refer to ri, the source of the teaching beyond words. The true source, ri, is beyond our thinking it is pure and stainless. When you describe it, you put a limitation on it. That is, you stain the truth or put a mark on it. In the Heart Sutra it says, no color, no sound, no smell, no taste, no touch, no objects of mind, and so forth. That is ri. The next line reads Shiha anni ruchusuthe branching streams flow on in the dark. Shiha means branch stream. Sekito says shiha for poetic reasons: to make these two lines of Buddha Is Always Herethe poem beautiful and to contrast shiha with reigen, source. Reigen is more noumenal, and shiha is more phenomenal. To say noumenal or phenomenal is not exactly right, but tentatively I have to say so. That is why it is good to remember the more technical terms ri and ji here. Ji, which is used in the third line here, refers to the phenomenalto something you can see, hear, smell, or taste as well as to objects of thought or ideas. Whatever can be introduced into our consciousness is ji. Something that is beyond our consciousnessthe noumenalis ri. In the darkness the branching streams flow everywhere, like water. Even when you are not aware of water, there is water. Water is inside our physical body and in plants too there is water all over. In the same way the pure source is everywhere. Each being is itself pure source, and pure source is nothing but each being. They are not two things. There is no difference between ri and ji, pure source and stream. The stream is pure source, and pure source is the stream. The pure source is flowing all over, even though you dont know it. This dont know is what we call dark, and it is very important. Grasping at things is surely delusion. Grasping at things means to stick to the many things you see. Understanding that each being is dierent, you see each one as something special, and usually you will then stick to something. Yet even if you recognize the truth that everything is one, that is not always enlightenment. It may be enlightenment, but not always. It is just intellectual understanding. An enlightened person does not ignore things and does not stick to things, not even to the truth. There is no truth that is dierent from what each being is. Each being is itself the truth. You may think that there is Third Talksome truth that is controlling each being. This truth, you may think, is like the truth of gravitation. If the apple is each being, then behind the apple is some truth working on the apple, like gravitation. To understand things in that way is not enlightenment. To stick to beings, ideas, even Buddhas teaching, saying, Buddhas teaching is something like this, is to stick to ji. This is the backbone of the Sandokai. According with sameness is still not enlightenment. To recognize the truth is not enlightenment either. It may be better not to say anything. If I translate ri into English, it is already ji. Enlightenment is not something you can experience, actually. It is beyond our experience. If someone says, I have attained enlightenment, that is wrong. It means that person sticks to some explanation of enlightenment. That is delusion. At the same time, if you think that enlightenment is beyond our experience, something that you cannot experience, even so, enlightenment is there. So you cannot say that there is no enlightenment or that there is enlightenment. Enlightenment is not something about which you can say there is or there is not. And at the same time, something that you can experience is enlightenment too. In the last talk I referred to the big dispute in Sekitos time about sudden enlightenment and gradual enlightenment. The Sutra of the Sixth Ancestor denounces Jinshus way as a way of gradual attainment, while declaring that the Sixth Ancestors way is sudden enlightenment. According to the Sutra of the Sixth Ancestor, it seems that just to sit is not true practice. But maybe that was not the Sixth Ancestors own idea. There is actually not much difference between Jinshus way Buddha Is Always Hereand the Sixth Ancestors way. The Sutra of the Sixth Ancestor was compiled right after the Sixth Ancestors death, and maybe fifty years later the criticism of Jinshus school of gradual attainment was added by Kataku Jinnea disciple of the Sixth Ancestoror by a disciple of Kataku Jinne after he had passed away. Kataku Jinne was a great Zen master. He was very active, and he was critical of Jinshus practice, but probably not as harshly as the words in the sutra convey. Kataku Jinne or his disciple may also have added this poem: There is no bodhi tree there is no mirror. There is no stand for the mirror there is nothing. How is it possible to wipe the mirror Because this is not such a good poem, many people criticize it and think that it cannot be the Sixth Ancestors poem. The Fifth Ancestor Daiman Konin wanted to find his successor. He asked the monks to write a poem to express their understanding. Jinshu, the head monk, wrote the following poem on the wall in the middle of the night:Our body is the bodhi tree, our mind a mirror bright. Carefully wipe them hour by hour, and let no dust alight. When Eno saw this the next day, he said to the monk standing next to him, I too have a poem. Since I am illiterate, would you write it down for meThere is no bodhi tree,nor stand of a mirror bright.Since all is void,where can the dust alight When Konin saw this, he knew the author had the understanding he was looking for, and he recognized Eno as his dharma heir and hence the Sixth Ancestor. Third Talk In those days it was an honor to own a copy of the Sutra of the Sixth Ancestor. There are many versions of it, and the oldest ones do not include this poem or any criticism of the Jinshu school. So one aim of the Sandokai is to clarify this wrong understanding concerning Jinshu, who is made to look as if he sticks to rituals or scholarly work. Scholarly study belongs to ji. Ri is something you can experience through practice. You may think that scholarly work is ri, but for us it is not so. To realize or have complete understanding of ri, to accept ri, is our practice. But even though you practice zazen and think that is ri, or the attainment or realization of ri, that is not always so, according to Sekito. If you understand this much you already understand the whole Sandokai. The first lines of the poem are the introduction: The mind of the great sage of India is intimately transmitted from west to east. Here great sage can also mean hermit. In Sekitos time, there were many Daoist hermits who were proud of their supernatural powers and who were seeking some elixir to prolong life. They were not much interested in Buddhist practice, and they couldnt understand why practicing zazen was so necessary. This was also a question for Dogen Zenji. If all of us have buddha nature, why is it necessary to practice Dogen suffered over this point. He couldnt resolve this problem through intellectual study. Zenji is an honorific Japanese Buddhist title meaning Zen master. Buddha Is Always Here When you really know yourself, you will realize how important it is to practice zazen. Before you know what you are doing, you dont know why we practice. You think you are quite free, that whatever you do is your choice, but actually you are creating karma for yourself and others. You dont know what youre doing, so you dont think there is any need to practice zazen. But we have to pay our own debts no one else can pay our debts. That is why it is necessary to practice. To fulfill our responsibility we practice. We have to. If you dont practice, you dont feel so good, and you also create some problems for others. But not knowing this you will say, Why is it necessary to practice Zen Moreover, when you say, We have buddha nature, you may think buddha nature is something like a diamond in your sleeve. But true buddha nature is not like this. A diamond is ji, not ri. We are always involved with the world of ji without realizing ri. There is something else I am very much interested in. Traditionally, as you may know, Buddhists say that Buddhism will not last forever. The sutras give various lengths of time, but usually they say it will perish years after Buddhas death. According to tradition, in the first five hundred years, in the time of Buddhas direct disciples or granddisciples, there would be great sages like Buddha. This is shobo, the time of Buddha. In the next five hundred years there would be people who practice zazen and study Buddhism. This is zobo, the time of dharma imitation. In mappo, the last period, beginning one thousand years after Buddhas death, people would not observe the precepts they would read and chant sutras, but they would Third Talknot be interested in zazen people who practice zazen and understand the teaching would be dicult to find. This is true, actually. People today do not observe the precepts. And in mappo, people would be involved in the ideas of emptiness and being, but they would not understand what is really meant by them. We talk about emptiness, and you may think you understand it but even though you can explain it pretty well, it is ji not ri. Real emptiness will be experienced not experienced, but realizedby good practice. So the purpose of the Sandokai is to make clear what emptiness is, what being is, what darkness is, what clarity is, what the true source of the teaching is, and who the various beings are who are supported by the true source of the teaching. I borrowed a book from Gary Snyders wife, Masa, about Sangaikyo, a small Tantric school in Japan. In that book it says that people years after the Buddhas death may be classified in two ways: innocent and shameless. This book explains what people are doing both here and in Japan. In a strict sense, neither the Japanese nor the Americans observe the precepts. In both countries we eat fish and kill animals. But in America you are very innocent. You dont know what you are actually doing when you violate the precepts. In Japan we are shameless because we know what we are doing and we still violate the precepts. Innocent people appear shameless, but it is not real shamelessness. So you may ask, What is the real teaching of Buddha If you dont understand it you will keep asking, What is it What is it What does it mean You are just seeking for Buddha Is Always Heresomething that you can understand. That is a mistake. We dont exist in that way. Dogen Zenji says, There is no bird who flies knowing the limit of the sky. There is no fish who swims knowing the end of the ocean. We exist in the limitless universe. Sentient beings are numberless and our desires are limitless, but we still have to continue making our effort just as a fish swims and a bird flies. So Dogen Zenji says, A bird flies like a bird a fish swims like a fish. That is the bodhisattvas way, and that is how we observe our practice. When we understand things in this way, according to Dogen, we are not people in mappo, the last period our practice is not disturbed by any framework of time or space. Dogen said, Buddha is always here. In some way, still, Buddhism exists, and when we really understand what Buddha meant, we are in Buddhas time. f o u r t h t a l kThe Blue Jay Will Come Right into Your HeartAll the objects of the sensesinteract and yet do not.Interacting brings involvement.Otherwise, each keeps its place.In the last talk I explained how people stick to ji, things. That is usual. The characteristic of Buddhas teaching is to go beyond thingsbeyond various beings, ideas, and material things. When we say truth, we usually mean something we can figure out. The truth that we can figure out or think about is ji. When we go beyond subjective and objective worlds, we come to the understanding of the oneness of everything, the oneness of subjectivity and objectivity, the oneness of inside and outside. For instance, when you sit zazen you are not thinking about anything or watching anything. Your focus is four or five feet ahead of you, but you do not watch anything. Even though many ideas come, we do not think about themthey come in and go out, thats all. We do not entertain various ideas we do not invite them to stay or serve them food or anything. If they come in, okay, and if they go out, okay. Thats all. That is zazen. When we practice in this way, even though we do not try, our mind includes everything. We are not concerned Fourth Talkabout, nor do we expect, something that may exist beyond our reach. Whatever we talk about at any moment is within our mind. Everything is within our mind. But usually we think there are many things: there is this, and this, and this out there. In the cosmos there are many stars, but right now we can only reach the moon. In a few years we may reach some other planets, and eventually we may reach some other solar system. In Buddhism, mind and being are one, not dierent. As there is no limit to cosmic being, there is no limit to our mind our mind reaches everywhere. It already includes the stars, so our mind is not just our mind. It is something greater than the small mind that we think is our mind. This is our understanding. Our mind and things are one. So if you think, All this is mind, that is so. If you think, Over there is some other being, that is also so. But more to the point, when Buddhists say this or that or , that this or that or I includes everything. Listen to the tone of it rather than just the words. Sound is dierent from noise. Sound is something that comes from your practice. Noise is something more objective, something that can bother you. If you strike a drum, the sound you make is the sound of your own subjective practice, and it is also the sound that encourages all of us. Sound is both subjective and objective. In Japan we say hibiki. Hibiki means something that goes back and forth like an echo. If I say something, I will get feedbackback and forth. That is sound. Buddhists understand a sound as something created in our mind. I may think, The The Blue Jay Will Come Right into Your Heartbird is singing over there. But when I hear the bird, the bird is me already. Actually, I am not listening to the bird. The bird is here in my mind already, and I am singing with the bird. Peeppeeppeep. If you think while you are studying, The blue jay is singing above my roof, but its voice is not so good, that thought is noise. When you are not disturbed by blue jays, blue jays will come right into your heart, and you will be a blue jay, and the blue jay will be reading something, and then the blue jay will not disturb your reading. When we think, The blue jay over my roof should not be there, that thought is a more primitive understanding of being. Because of our lack of practice, we understand things in that way. The more you practice zazen, the more you will be able to accept something as your own, whatever it is. That is the teaching of jiji muge from the Kegon Ch. Huayen school. Jiji means being that has no barrier, no disturbance. Because things are interrelated, it is dicult to say, This is a bird and this is me. It is dicult to separate the blue jay from me. That is jiji muge. The text says, All the objects of the senses interact and yet do not. Although things are interrelated, everyone every being can be the boss. Each one of us can be a boss because we are so closely related. If I say Mel, Mel is already not just Mel. He is one of Zen Centers students, so to see Mel is to see Zen Center. If you see Mel you understand what Zen Center is. But if you think, Oh, he is just Mel, then your understanding is not good enough. You dont know who Mel is. If you have a good understanding of things themselves, you Fourth Talkwill understand the whole world through things. Each one of us is the boss of the whole world. And when you have this understanding, you will realize that things are interrelated, yet they are also independent. Each one of us is completely and absolutely independent. There is nothing to compare. You are just you. We have to understand things in two ways. One way is to understand things as interrelated. The other way is to understand ourselves as quite independent from everything. When we include everything as ourselves, we are completely independent because there is nothing with which to compare ourselves. If there is only one thing, how can you compare anything to it Because there is nothing to compare yourself to, this is absolute independencenot interrelated, absolutely independent. Now the text says, All the objects of the senses. The sensesour eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and bodyare gates, and sense objects enter the gates. They are interrelated and at the same time independent. For eyes there is something to see, for ears there is something to hear, for the nose something to smell, for the tongue something to taste, for the body something to touch. There are five kinds of sense objects for the five sense organs. This is Buddhist common sense. Referring to them here in the poem is just a way of saying everything. It is the same as saying flowers and trees, birds and stars, streams and mountains, but instead we say each sense and its objects.So the various beings that we see and hear are interrelated,The Blue Jay Will Come Right into Your Heartbut at the same time, each being is absolutely independent and has its own value. This value we call ri. Ri is that which makes something meaningful, not just theoretical. Even though you dont attain enlightenment, we say you already have enlightenment. That enlightenment we call ri. The fact that something exists here means there is some reason for it. I dont know the reason. No one knows. Everything must have its own value. It is very strange that no two things are the same. There is nothing to compare yourself to, so you have your own value. That value is not a comparative value or an exchange value it is more than that. When you are just sitting zazen on the cushion you have your own value. Although that value is related to everything, that value is also absolute. Maybe it is better not to say too much. Interacting brings involvement. A bird comes from the south in spring and goes back in the fall, crossing various mountains, rivers, and oceans. In this way, things are interrelated endlessly, everywhere. Otherwise, each keeps its place. This means that even though the bird stays in some place, at some lake, for instance, his home is not only the lake but also the whole world. That is how a bird lives. In Zen sometimes we say that each one of us is steep like a cli. No one can scale us. We are completely independent. But when you hear me say so, you should understand the other side toothat we are endlessly interrelated. If you only understand one side of the truth, you cant hear what Im saying. If you dont understand Zen words, you dont understand Fourth TalkZen, you are not yet a Zen student. Zen words are dierent from usual words. Like a doubleedged sword, they cut both ways. You may think I am only cutting forward, but no, actually I am also cutting backward. Watch out for my stick. Do you understand Sometimes I scold a discipleNo! The other students think, Oh, he has been scolded, but it is not actually so. Because I cannot scold the one over there, I have to scold the one who is near me. But most people think, Oh, that poor guy is being scolded. If you think like that you are not a Zen student. If someone is scolded you should listen you should be alert enough to know who is being scolded. This is how we train. When I was quite a young disciple, my dharma brothers and I went somewhere with our teacher and came back pretty late. There are many venomous snakes in Japan. My teacher said, You are wearing tabi white socks worn with sandals, and I am not. A snake may bite me, so you go ahead. We agreed and walked ahead of him. As soon as we reached the temple he said to us, All of you sit down. We didnt know what had happened, but we all sat down in front of him. What inconsiderate boys you are, he said. When I am not wearing tabi, why do you wear tabi I gave you a warning: I am not wearing tabi. You should have understood and taken o your tabi too, but instead you kept them on and walked ahead of me. What silly boys you are. We should be alert enough to hear the meaning behind the words. Thats all. We should realize something more than what is said. The Blue Jay Will Come Right into Your Heart One night, when I was a student at Eiheiji monastery, I opened the right side of the sliding shoji doorbecause it is customary to open that sidebut I was scolded. Dont open that side! one of the senior monks said. So the next morning I opened the left side, and I was scolded again: Why do you open that side I didnt know what to do. When I opened the right side I was scolded, and when I opened the left side I was scolded again. I couldnt figure out why. But at last I noticed that the first time, a guest had been on the right side, and the second time, a guest had been on the left side. So both times I had opened a side so that a guest had been exposed. That was why I was scolded. At Eiheiji they never told us why, they just scolded us. Their words were doubleedged. The Sandokais words are also doubleedged. One side is interdependence ego and one side is absolute independence fuego. This interdependency goes on and on everywhere, and yet things stay in their own places. That is the main point of the Sandokai.d i s c u s s i o nStudent: Does interdependence mean the bird is the whole world, and independence mean the bird is just a birdSuzuki Roshi: Yes. In the Heart Sutra we say form is emptiness, emptiness is form. Form is emptinessego. And Founded in the thirteenth century by Eihei Dogen, Eiheiji is one of the two head temples of the Soto school of Zen. Fourth Talkemptiness is formfuego. Knocks on the table. This is fuego. You cannot say anything, you know. It is dicult to say what it is. Knocks on the table again.Student: Is there any particular reason why we strike the bell as we chant the first syllable of Mommon issai no kyoSuzuki Roshi: To hit the bell means to produce an independent buddha, one buddha after another. Gong. Buddha. One independent buddha appears. Gong. Another independent buddha appears. When the next buddha appears, the previous buddha disappears. So one by one, striking one after another, you produce a buddha, one after another. That is our practice.Student: Roshi, today someone said, No students, no teacher no teacher, no students. Someone else asked, Well, what makes the roshi the roshi And someone said, Because he has students. You cant be the roshi without students. Students cant be students without the roshi. They are both independent because they are together.Suzuki Roshi: Yes, together. Without students, no teacher. And the students encourage the teacher. It is very much so. If I have no students I may goof o every day. Because I have so many students watching me, I must do something I must study so that I can give a lecture. If there is no lecture, I will not study.The Blue Jay Will Come Right into Your HeartBut at the same time I shall be very much ashamed of myself if I study just to give the lecture. So usually, when I study for a lecture I go o in another direction, following something interesting, and most of the time I dont study for the lecture. But still, if I dont study I dont feel so good. Because I feel it is necessary to prepare for the lecture, I start to study. But as soon as I start, I go o on my own and study for the sake of studying, not just for giving the lecture. Things are going on in this way endlessly. And it is good, you know. Someday, what I study will help students. I dont know when. Just to feel good we study, and just to feel better we practice zazen. No one knows what will happen to us after sitting one, two, or ten years. No one knows, and it is right that no one knows. Just to feel good we sit zazen, actually. Eventually that kind of purposeless practice will help you. f i f t h t a l kToday We May Be Very Happy, and the Next Day We Dont Know What Will Happen to UsSights vary in quality and form, sounds dier as pleasing or harsh.Refined and common speech come together in the dark, clear and murky phrases are distinguished in the light.Everything has its own nature and form, and when you hear a voice it is either agreeable or disagreeable. Here the Sandokai is talking about sights and sounds, but the same is true for of all the senses, as well as the mind. There are good and bad tastes, good and bad feelings, agreeable and disagreeable ideas. It is our attachment to them that creates suffering. When you hear something good you will enjoy it. When you hear something bad you will be annoyed or disturbed. But if you understand reality completely you will not be bothered by things. The next phrase gives the reason: Refined and common speech come together in the darkAn wa jochu no koto ni kanai. We understand things in two ways: in darkness an and in the light of form shiki, where we see things as good and bad. We know that there is no good or bad in things themselves. It is we who dierentiate things as good or bad and thus create good or bad. If we know this we will not suffer so much. Oh, that is what I am doing! Fifth Talk Things in themselves have no good or bad nature. To understand this is to understand things in utter darkness. Then you are not involved in a dualistic understanding of things as good or bad. Sekito says, Refined and common speech come together in the dark. Darkness includes good and bad. In utter darkness, good words and bad words will not disturb you. Clear and murky phrases are distinguished in the light. There are pure words and muddy words. In brightness we have dualistic words, the duality of pure and impure. Even though we are angry at someone, we can still acknowledge that person. Because a teacher knows a student very well, sometimes the teacher will be angry with him. The teacher knows that the student is very good, but sometimes the student will be lazy. Then the teacher will hit him. Sometimes the teacher will praise or encourage him. But it does not mean we are using dierent methods or attitudes. The understanding is the same, but the expression is dierent. Students who are pessimistic, who see things very negatively, should be encouraged. But if they are too good or too bright, then the teacher will scold them. That is our way. We say the positive way and the negative way. The positive way is to acknowledge things in terms of good or bad, beautiful or ugly. If you make a good effort you will be a good student. To acknowledge a students effort is the positive way. The negative way is not to accept anything. Whatever you say, you will get thirty blows. Positive and negative sometimes one and sometimes the other. Usually we are very Today We May Be Very Happymuch attached to either the bright side or the dark side of things. Do you know this famous koan A monk asked a master, It is so hot. How is it possible to escape from the heat And the master said, Why dont you go to a place where it is neither cold nor hot The disciple said, Is there a place where it is neither cold nor hot The master said, When it is cold you should be cold buddha. When it is hot you should be hot buddha. You may think that if you practice zazen you will attain a stage where it is neither cold nor hot, where there is no pleasure or suffering. You may ask, If we practice zazen is it possible to have that kind of attainment The true teacher will say, When you suffer you should suffer. When you feel good you should feel good. Sometimes you should be a suffering buddha. Sometimes you should be a crying buddha. And sometimes you should be a very happy buddha. This happiness is not exactly the same as the happiness that people usually have. There is a little difference, and that little difference is significant. Because buddhas know both sides of reality, they have this kind of composure. They are not disturbed by something bad, or ecstatic about something good. They have a true joy that will always be with them. The basic tone of life remains the same, and in it there are some happy melodies and some sad melodies. That is the feeling an enlightened person may have. It means that when it is hot, or when you are sad, you should be completely involved in being hot or being sad, without caring for happiness. When you are happy you should just enjoy the happiness. We can do this Fifth Talkbecause we are ready for anything. Even though circumstances change suddenly, we dont mind. Today we may be very happy, and the next day we dont know what will happen to us. When we are ready for what will happen tomorrow, then we can enjoy today completely. You do this not by studying a lecture but through your practice. These are Sekitos words. Later, in Tozans time three generations after Sekito people got stuck in word games about brightness and darkness. They liked talking about the bright side, the dark side, and the middle way, but they lost the point of how to obtain real freedom. Dogen Zenji, who lived still later, did not get caught up in these word games so much. Rather he emphasized how to get out of word games by fully appreciating things moment after moment. He was more interested in a koan like, When it is cold you should be a cold buddha when it is hot you should be a hot buddha. Thats all. To be completely involved in what you are doing without thinking about various things is Dogens way. This kind of attainment is reached through actual practice, not through words. Words can help your understanding of things. When you are very dualistic, when you are getting confused, they can help you. But if you are too interested in talking about these things, you will lose your way. We should be interested in actual zazen, not in these words, and we should practice actual zazen. Dogen Zenjis way is to find the meaning in each being like a grain of rice or a cup of water. You may say a cup of Today We May Be Very Happywater or a grain of rice is something that you see in brightness. But when you pay full respect to the grain of rice, I mean when you actually respect it as you respect Buddha himself, then you will understand that a grain of rice is absolute. When you live completely involved in the dualistic world, you have the absolute world in its true sense. When you practice zazen without seeking for enlightenment or seeking for anything, then there is true enlightenment.d i s c u s s i o nStudent: When something happens and I suffer because of it, part of me feels the pain and part of me is trying to understand the pain at the same time. I dont know whether I try to understand because Im afraid of letting go and just feeling the pain, or whether thats wise understanding.Suzuki Roshi: You have this difficulty because you are involved in a problem for yourself. As long as you are involved in personal problems, whatever understanding you may have is only on the bright side. You have no chance to realize the other sidedarkness, the absolute. I am talking now as if I am an enlightened person, and you are listening to this as if you are an enlightened person. In other words, all of us are bodhisattvas, and as bodhisattvas we are discussing this kind of problem. But when you apply this kind of talk just to gain an intellectual understanding of your problem, you have no chance to understand the other side of it. That is why you have this problem. If you are really practicing the bodhisattva way,Fifth Talkwhatever side it may be is okay. When you criticize yourself, it is okay when you do what you want to do, that is also okay. You are not doing two dierent things. Whatever you do is always good according to the situation, but you dont have confidence in your actions or in your life because you are involved in selfish or personal practice.Student: When I am fully awake I have, maybe, a little control over my desires, but in the morningSuzuki Roshi: In the morning you have trouble. I know that. So that is why I say, Get up! Knocks on the table.Student: How do you do thatSuzuki Roshi: Just do it. Or else someone will come and hit you! Makes a sort of humorous growl.Student: I did just get up a couple of timesI jumped out of bed. But it was such a big thing!Suzuki Roshi: Yes. A big thing. So if you can get up pretty well, I think your practice is almost okay. That is a very good chance to practice our way. Just get up. Okay That is the most important thing.Student: Roshi, what does studying a book give youSuzuki Roshi: For you it may not be so important. But for me,Today We May Be Very HappyI must have some clear picture of what Im talking about, or else I cannot say anything. That is why I study before I lecture. My teacher always told me, Even though it doesnt help, before you lecture you should study. Laughter.s i x t h t a l kThe Boat Is Always MovingThe four elements return to their natures just as a child turns to its mother. Fire heats, wind moves,water wets, earth is solid.According to Buddhist thought, the four elements are fire, wind, water, and earth. Though not a perfect description, we say that these four elements each have their own nature. The nature of fire is to purify. Wind brings things to maturity. I dont know why, but windnature encourages things to be more mature. Wind has a more organic activity, while the activity of fire is more chemical. The nature of water is to contain things. Wherever you go there is water water contains everything. This is opposite to the usual way of thinking about water. Instead of saying there is water in the trunk of the tree, we say that water contains the trunk of the tree as well as the leaves and branches. So water is something vast in which everything, including ourselves, exists. Solidness is the nature of earth. Earth here does not mean land, but rather the solid nature of matter. According to Buddhism, if you analyze a thing into the smallest unit imaginable, that smallest final unit is called gokumi. Although sometimes defined as atom, it is not really the atom because the atom is not the final unit. I do not Sixth Talkknow the proper terms, but according to my understanding of modern physics the smallest, final unit of being has no weight or size. It is just electrical energy. Strangely enough, Buddhism has a similar idea. Although gokumi has the four elementsfire, wind, water, and earth it is not something solid. When we reach this point, we see that its nature is just emptiness. The four elements are not just material. They are energy or potential or readiness. This is gokumi. To these four elements we add the quality of emptiness. So fire, wind, water, and earth are all empty. Even though they are empty, from this emptiness these four elements come into being. And as soon as these four come into being, right there is the final unit, gokumi. That is a Buddhist understanding of being. It looks as if we are talking about matter, but these elements are not just matter. They are both spirit and matter. Thinking mind is included. Accordingly, emptiness includes both matter and spirit, both mind and object, both the subjective world and the objective world. Emptiness is the final being, which our thinking mind cannot reach. Each of the four elements, then, resumes its own nature, that is, comes to emptiness. Just as a child turns to its mother. Without the mother there is no child. That the child is here means the mother is here. That emptiness is here means that the four elements are here. And even though the four elements are here, they are nothing but a momentary formation of the final emptiness. In these four lines, and in the six lines that follow, Sekito is explaining reality in two ways: one is independence and the The Boat Is Always Movingother is dependence. He talks first about the truth of independence. Although there are four elements, these elements naturally resume their original natures. Although there are many things, each one of them is independent. A child, even though it has a mother, is independent. Fire is independent in its nature of heat, wind is independent in its nature of movement, water is independent in its nature of moisture, and earth is independent in its nature of solidity. Each thing is independent. I want to read the lines for the next talk so that you can understand the lines for this talk better.Eye and sight, ear and sound, nose and smell, tongue and taste.Thus for each and every thing,depending on these roots, the leaves spread forth.Trunk and branches share the essencerevered and common, each has its speech. These lines express the understanding of what I call independency. Each one of you is independent, but you are related to each other. Even though you are related to each other, you are independent. You can say it both ways. Do you understand Usually when we say independent, we have no idea of dependent. But that is not a Buddhist understanding of reality. We always try to understand things completely so we will not be mixed up. We should not be confused by dependence or independence. If someone says, Everything is independent, we say, Okay, that is so. And if someone Sixth Talkelse says, Things are interrelated, that is also true. We understand both sides. So whichever you say, that is okay. But if someone sticks to the idea of independence only, we will say to him, No, you are wrong. There are many koans like this. For example: If the final karmic fire burns everything up, at that time will the buddha nature exist Sometimes the teacher will answer, Yes, it will exist. But at another time he will answer, No, it will not exist. Both are true. Someone may ask him, Then why did you say it will exist That person will get a big slap. What are you thinking about Dont you understand what I mean That buddha nature will not exist is right, and that it will exist is also right. From the viewpoint of independency, everything exists with buddha nature no matter what happens to this world. But even so, nothing exists when seen from the viewpoint of utter darkness or the absolute. That which exists is nothingness, or darkness, in which the many things exist as one. Many things exist, but there is nothing you can see or say about that. There is no way to understand things by explaining them individually. This is just an intellectual description. We must have an actual feeling of it as well. If you can just appreciate each thing, one by one, then you will have pure gratitude. Even though you observe just one flower, that one flower includes everything. It is not just a flower. It is the absolute, it is Buddha himself. We see it in that way. But at the same time, that which exists is just a flower, and there is no one to see it and nothing to be seen. That is the feeling we should have in our practice and in our every The Boat Is Always Movingday activity. Then, whatever work you do, you will have a continuous feeling of pure gratitude. When we think about something in terms of duality, we observe and understand it intellectually. Even so, it is important that we do not stick to our ideas. That understanding should be improved day by day by our pure nondual thinking. We say, You cannot catch a fish in the same place twice. Today, you were fortunate to catch a big fish at a certain place, but tomorrow you should fish in some other place. We also have the saying Notch the rail of the boat in order to mark our location. The boat is moving, but you mark the rail to remember the place: Oh, there was something beautiful, and we should remember it. Marking it doesnt help, because the boat is always moving. But we do it just the same. This is a good example of the thinking mind. It shows our foolishness and suggests to us what Buddhist life is. Do you know the old Chinese story of the hunter who sees a rabbit run into a tree stump He comes back the next day and waits for another rabbit to run into the stump. This is very foolish. If a rabbit comes, we are lucky. If he doesnt, we shouldnt complain. We should appreciate what we see here, right now. Oh, a beautiful flower! We should fully appreciate it. But we should not mark it on the rail of the boat.d i s c u s s i o nStudent: In a previous talk, you said that if we understand our closeness, our dependence on other things, then we are indeSixth Talkpendent. Are we independent even if we dont understand thisSuzuki Roshi: Actually, it is so, but the point is that you dont feel that way, so you dont understand it in that way. Yet even though you dont have a really close feeling toward others, if you know this fact even intellectually, you will not make too big a mistake. Or at least you will not stick to one side only, or you will not be so arrogant. There is something very important here. When I talk this way, I am talking about things as if I am a completely enlightened person. For an enlightened person this is very true, but for people who are not enlightened it is just talk. When our practice follows this understanding, that is true Buddhism. Our practice should not be just intellectual. Even if you practice hard, without this kind of understanding your practice doesnt make much sense. It is still involved in the idea of somethingness.Student: You said that for an enlightened person its very true, and for a nonenlightened person its just talk.Suzuki Roshi: Whats missing Practice is missing. Only when you practice zazen hard is it true. At the same time, even though you practice hard, your practice will not always be complete. There may be a big gap between the truth and your understanding or actual experience. Your intellectual understanding may be high, but your practice may be low. To haveThe Boat Is Always Movingan intellectual understanding is easy, but practicing with emotions is dicult because we easily stick to something emotionally. So we say, It is easy to understand nothingness, and It is easy to destroy an intellectual understanding. But to deal with emotional difficulty is as hard as splitting a lotus in two. Long strings will follow and you cannot get rid of them. The strings remain. With intellectual difficulty, it is as easy as breaking a stone in two. Nothing is left.Student: When I see a situation in which one person seems to be hurting another, I become emotionally upset. Am I becoming upset because Im not seeing the situation as it actually is If I were seeing it as it actually is, would I not be upsetSuzuki Roshi: That is a very dicult question to answer. It is dicult to know whether one person is helping another in an appropriate way or not. If it is not appropriate, you will be upset. At least you will worry. But even when someone is helping another properly you may be upset. That happens, you know. If someone is helping your girlfriend or boyfriend in an appropriate way, you may get upset anyway. That kind of thing happens pretty often.Student: Roshi, my question is more like this: If a person really sees things clearly, is there then no situation that would upset him emotionallySuzuki Roshi: Upset emotionally I dont think so. But aected, yes. There is a big difference between these two. A buddhaSixth Talkmay be upset quite easily, in the sense of being deeply aected. But when he is upset, it is not because of his attachments. Sometimes he will be very angry. Anger is allowed when it is buddhas anger. But that anger is not the same as the anger we usually have. If a buddha is not upset when he should be upset, that is also a violation of the precepts. When he needs to be angry, he must be angry. That is a characteristic of the Mahayana way of observing precepts. We say, Sometimes anger is like a sunset. Even though it looks like anger, actually it is a beautiful red sunset. If anger comes from pure mind, from purity like a lotus, it is good.Student: Roshi, Ive observed that our emotions seem to be independent of our intellectual understanding and have a life of their own that has nothing to do with what we know or understand. What is the source of emotion in our body or mind Where does it come fromSuzuki Roshi: It mostly comes from a physical source. Maybe it is a physiological thing. The thinking mind is like a river. When we think, we think in a universal, river way, ignoring physical and physiological conditions. If we focused on the various possible conditionsfive, ten, twenty, one hundred, or moreit would not be possible to think. A characteristic of the thinking mind is to ignore all the conditions and follow its own track, so a person tends to just think and go on. Whatever happens, it doesnt matter. What are you talking about We should do this! This may be more The Boat Is Always Movingof a mans way. A womans way may be to attend to the various conditions, carefully observing them and figuring out what to do bit by bit. There is a similarity between the thinking mind and emotional practice. A practitioner doesnt become so involved with things either emotionally or intellectually, so it is easier to see things for what they are.Student: I have some difficulty listening to these talks. When I used to chant the Sandokai knowing nothing about what it meant, I was able to concentrate on nothing but my breathing and my voice coming from my hara. But now I start thinking about what the Sandokai means and I lose touch with what I am doing. I get attached to the words and to the idea that there is the dark side, the ri, becoming the ji side. Now when I chant the Sandokai, the intellectual side, the bright side, is strong and I dont enjoy chanting it. Maybe you can give me some advice on how to avoid this kind of difficulty.Suzuki Roshi: You cannot avoid it. That is why I am talking to you. You have to polish your understanding.Student: You said the other day that in the morning we should just get up. Usually I just get up, but this morning when I woke up, I didnt get right up. I waited until the wakeup bell came back again, and then I started to think about what you said in the talks. The vital center of the body, just below the navel.Sixth TalkSuzuki Roshi: That was not just because of the talks. That was not my fault! Laughing.Student: My question is: can we have subjective understanding of our practice without having some kind of objective or right understanding, or do we have to have both of them and balance them Can we practice Buddhas way without knowing Buddhas way intellectuallySuzuki Roshi: If you can, you are very lucky. But, unfortunately, we cannot practice without intellectual understanding.Student: When we sit zazen and have correct posture and follow our breathing, do we need these concepts about Buddhism or about the four elementsSuzuki Roshi: No, at that time we should forget them.Student: I mean, do we have to understand the idea of Buddhism to practiceSuzuki Roshi: We have to because we tend to look at things in that way. Back and forthstudy and practice. We have to polish our understanding so that we will not be intellectually mixed up. That is important.s e v e n t h t a l kWithout Any Idea of Attainment, Just to Sit Is Our WayEye and sight, ear and sound, nose and smell, tongue and taste. Thus for each and every thing,depending on these roots, the leaves spread forth.Trunk and branches share the essencerevered and common, each has its speech.In my last lecture I explained the meaning of the independency of everything. Although things are interdependent with respect to each other, at the same time, each being is independent. When each being includes the whole world, then each being is actually independent. Sekito was talking about the nature of reality at a time when most people, forgetting all about this point, were judging which school of Zen was right or wrong. That is why Sekito Zenji wrote this poem. Here he is talking about reality from the viewpoint of independency. The Southern school is independent and the Northern school is independent, and there is no reason why we should compare them in order to decide which is correct. Both schools are expressing the whole of Buddhism in their own wayjust as the Rinzai school has its own approach to reality, and the Soto school has its own approach. Sekito Zenji is pointing this out. Although he refers to the dispute between the Northern and Southern schools, at the same time he is talking about the nature of reality and what Buddhas teaching is in its true sense. Seventh Talk Now I want to explain these lines, which describe reality from the viewpoint of independency. Eye and sight, ear and sound, nose and smell, tongue and taste. It looks as if Sekito is talking dualistically about the dependency of eyes on their objects. But when you see something, if you see it in its true sense there is nothing to be seen and no one to see it. Only when you analyze it is there someone seeing something and something that is seen. It is one activity that can be understood in two ways. I see something, but really there is no one seeing it and nothing to be seen. Both of these are true. Here Sekito is talking about this oneness of eye and form. That is how Buddhists observe things. We understand things in a dualistic way, but we dont forget that our understanding is dualistic. I see. Or someone or something is seen by someone. These are interpretations of subject and object that our thinking mind produces. Subject and object are one, but they are also two. Sekito is saying that for eyes, there is form. But at the same time there are no eyes and no form. When you say eyes, eyes include the form. When you say form, form includes the eyes. If there is no form and nothing to see, eyes are not eyes anymore. Because there is something to see, eyes become eyes. The same is true of ears, nose, and tongue. Dogen Zenji says, If there is no river, there is no boat. Even though there is a boat, it will not be a boat. Because there is a river, a boat can become a boat. Usually the reason that people become attached to the objective world, or to something they see, is because they understand things in only one way. Their understanding is that something exists indepen Without Any Idea of Attainmentdent of them. That is the normal way of understanding. Here is something very sweet to eat. But cake becomes cake because we want to eat it. So we make a cake. There is no cake without us. When we understand things in this way, we are seeing cake, but we are not seeing cake. This is in keeping with the precepts. Maybe you will kill some animal or insect. But when you think, There are many earwigs here and they are harmful insects, so I have to kill this one, you understand things only in a dualistic way. Actually, earwigs and human beings are one. They are not dierent. It is impossible to kill an earwig. Even though we think we have killed it, we have not. Even though you squash the earwig, it is still alive. That momentary form may vanish, but as long as the whole world, including us, exists, we cannot kill an earwig. When we come to this understanding, we can keep our precepts completely. But even so, we should not kill anything without a reason, or we should not kill by making up some convenient reason. Because earwigs eat vegetables I must kill them. There is nothing wrong with killing animals, so I am killing earwigs. To kill an animal, excusing your action through some reasoning, is not our way. Actually, when you kill an animal, you dont feel so good. That is also included in our understanding: Even though I dont feel so good about it, I have to kill. Even though it is not possible, still I may kill an animal. In this way, things go on in the big world. Sticking to some idea of killing or not killing, or to some reason why we kill or dont kill, is not the way of observing Seventh Talkprecepts. The way to observe precepts is to have a complete understanding of reality. That is how you dont kill. Do you understand How you understand my lecture, how you practice zazen, is how you dont kill. In other words, you should not live in the world of duality only. You can observe our world from the dualistic viewpoint and from the viewpoint of the absolute. It is not good to kill is the dualistic viewpoint. Even though you think you killed, you did not kill is the absolute viewpoint. Even though you violate your precepts, if after doing it you feel very sorry, if you say I am sorry to the earwig, it is Buddhas way. In this way our practice will go on and on. You may think that if there are precepts you should observe them literally or else you cannot be Buddhists. But if you feel good just because you observe some precept, that is not the way either. To feel sorry when we kill an animal is included in our precepts. Everyone is involved in this kind of activity. But the way we do it and the feeling we have may not be the same for everyone. One person has no idea of precepts or attainment. Another is trying to make himself feel good through religious activity or by observing precepts. That is not the Buddhist way. The Buddhist way is, in one word, jihi, compassion. Jihi means to encourage people when they are feeling positive and also to help them get rid of their suffering. That is true love. It is not just to give something or to receive something or to observe precepts that we practice our way. We practice our way with things as they naturally occur, going with people, suffering with them, helping to relieve their suffering, and en Without Any Idea of Attainmentcouraging them to go on and on. This is how we observe the precepts. We see something but we do not see something. We always feel the oneness of the subjective and objective worlds, the oneness of eye and form, the oneness of tongue and taste. So we dont have to attach to something in a special way, and we dont have to feel especially good because of our Buddhist practice. When we practice in this way, we are independent. That is what Sekito is talking about. Thus for each and every thing, depending on these roots, the leaves spread forth. Eyes, nose, tongue, ears, sight, smell, taste, and hearing: all these are dharmas, and each dharma is rooted in the absolute, which is buddha nature. When observing many things, we should look beyond their appearance and know how each thing exists. Because of the root we exist because of the absolute buddha nature we exist. Understanding things in this way, we have oneness. Trunk and branches share the essence revered and common, each has its speech. The words we use are dierent good words and bad words, respectful words and mean wordsbut through these words we should understand the absolute being or source of the teaching. That is what Sekito is talking about here. In the Bonmokyo, an important scripture on the precepts, it says, To see is not to see, and not to see is to see. To eat meat is not to eat meat not to eat meat is to eat meat. You understand the precepts in only one way. You observe the precepts by not eating meat. But not to eat meat is to eat meat. Actually, you are eating meat. Do you understand That is Seventh Talkhow we observe the precepts. Dont commit unchaste acts. To see a woman is not to see a woman. Not to see a woman is to see a woman. There were two monks traveling together, and they came to a big river where there was no bridge to cross. While they were standing on the bank a beautiful woman came along. One of them carried her on his back across the river. Later, the other monk became furious. You are a monk! You violated the precept not to touch a woman. Why did you do that The monk who had helped the woman replied, You are still carrying the woman. I already forgot about her. You are the one who is violating the precepts. Maybe as a monk it was not completely right for him to carry the woman. Even so, as all human beings are friends, we should help them even if it means violating a Buddhist precept. If you think about the precepts only in a limited or literal way, that is actually violating the precepts. So to see the woman was not to see the woman. When the monk crossed the river with her on his back, actually he was not helping her. Do you understand So not to help her was to help her in the true sense. When you are involved in the dualistic sense of precepts man and woman, monk and laymanthat is violating the precepts and is a poor understanding of Buddhas teaching. Without any idea of attainment, without any idea of doing anything, without any idea of meaningful practice, just to sit is our way. To be completely involved in sitting meditation is our zazen. And this is how we observe our precepts. Sometimes we will be angry, and sometimes we will smile. Some Without Any Idea of Attainmenttimes we will be mad at our friends, and sometimes we will give them a kind word. But actually what we are doing is just observing our way. I cannot explain it so well, but I think you must understand what I mean.d i s c u s s i o nStudent: I dont feel that talking about Buddhism or the Sandokai is the same as my life or my practice. I feel some separation. Talking about it seems like something else. Its way out there.Suzuki Roshi: I felt that way myself for a pretty long time. It is rather dicult to communicate some feeling through my talk. That is why the old masters twisted their students noses or hit them. Right here! What are you thinking about In short, that is the point. I am going around and around the point, so I am using words. We speak of scratching an itchy foot with our shoe on. It doesnt help so much, but even so I have to talk.Student: You said that when we kill an earwig or any insect, we cant kill it as long as everything is here. Do you mean that each thing will always be each thing, this lecture will always be this lectureSuzuki Roshi: When you see thingsasitis, it is so.Student: If the body of the earwig dies, what happens to the earwigs karma Where does the earwig goSeventh TalkSuzuki Roshi: Earwigs go to the source of reality. They know where to go. When we speak in this way you will feel that it is just talk. But when you suffer a lot it will be a great relief to know that.Student: Roshi, what is the difference between you and meSuzuki Roshi: There is difference and no differencethat is why we practice together. Because there is some difference we practice together, and because we are not dierent we practice together. If you are completely dierent from me, there is no reason why you should practice with me and if we are completely the same, there is no reason why we should practice together. Because we are dierent, we practice our way, and because we are originally the same, we practice our way. Not dierent and dierent. This kind of thing is not easy to know. Traditional practice starts from the source of the teaching, which is nothingness, which is absolute, which is nonduality. Usually you are attracted to something through your eyes or nose, through sight or smell or some form, but not through this original source of the teaching. The original source is not something that can be described, so we say tongueless speech. We are talking about something that is impossible to talk about. That is called teisho, not lecture. We can explain this with words, but we are explaining what is empty, so we call these words the finger pointing at the moon. If you understand what the moon is, the finger is not necessary anymore. What you should understand is not myWithout Any Idea of Attainmentwords. You should realize by your true experience what I mean. You are blind to this point, so you feel I am talking about something in a sophisticated way that looks like the so called Buddhist way. The Buddhist way is not these words but the meaning behind the words.Student: In killing the earwig there are no words or memories or anything. There is just the experience of killing the earwig. Is that the teacher that leads you to the source Is the experience of killing the earwig, not the talk about it, the teacherSuzuki Roshi: At that time you neednt feel like a good Buddhist or a sinful monk or think about violating your precepts. When you are working in the garden for some purpose you should be involved in that activity completely. Sometimes you may be mad at the earwigs, but no one can criticize you. If you are expelled from Tassajara because you killed a lot of earwigs, you should go. Okay, I will go. You should have that much confidencenot confidence, it is more than confidence. You shouldnt have to fight with anyone. If you have that much understanding of what you are doing, that is good the way is there.Student: When we say we shouldnt harm sentient beings, earwigs or anything else, do we say that because it is impossible to harm them, or because it is wrong to harm them, or bothSeventh TalkSuzuki Roshi: Both. And we should know that it is not possible. Why it is not possible is because these are just words. Words cannot reach that place. Only when you get caught by words do you say possible or impossible. Killing something, sacrificing somethingthat is how you actually live every day. Applying Buddhas teaching just to give yourself some excuse, even if it does make you feel better, is a very superficial understanding of Buddhism. You cannot help feeling bad when you kill something. This is also a superficial understanding. But that does not mean that you are doing something wrong, because you are not actually killing. Both are true. But if you say, Because I am not killing anything it is okay to kill, that is wrong, because you are sticking to an idea or a precept that itself is just words. It is not the true heart, the true feeling of Buddha.Student: Roshi, every animal has a way of living, of eating, of raising its young, of relating to its world that is in keeping with the particular dharma or dao of its being. Doesnt mankind also have a particular way of living and eating and raising our young that is in keeping with our dharma or daoSuzuki Roshi: Not absolutely. Rather, we have to make our best effort to keep the dharmathats what these words are about. Words are necessary, but even though they are necessary, you shouldnt think they are complete. We should make constant effort to produce new dharma, new precepts. We say,Without Any Idea of AttainmentThis is human life. But this human life is for today, not tomorrow. Tomorrow we must have better ways to live. This kind of effort should be continued. When we feel bad it means we should improve our way. But you should not expect a perfect dharma that says clearly you should or you shouldnt. No one can insist on their own way, but we should appreciate their effort to improve the dharma. Does this make senseStudent: You say that we must always, every day, improve our way, make our best effort. I have also heard you say, For the true teaching to be passed on, the disciple must surpass the teacher. Can we carry on the dharma even if we dont surpass the teacherSuzuki Roshi: Yes. Surpass is also a dualistic word, so we should not stick to it. There is no reason why I should feel good or bad if you surpass me. To talk about which is better is just words. Even to create one page of new dharma is very dicult. Even though you feel that you have invented something new, the Buddha is always waiting there for you. Buddha will say, Oh, come here. Good for you! Come nearer to me. I have some more things for you. It is very hard to surpass his teaching.e i g h t h t a l kWithin Light There Is Utter DarknessIn the light there is darkness,but dont take it as darkness.In the dark there is light,but dont see it as light.First I will talk about the two terms mei and an, light and darkness. Light means the relative, dualistic world of words, the thinking world, the visible world in which we live. Darkness refers to the absolute, where there is no exchange value or materialistic value or even spiritual valuethe world that our words and thinking mind cannot reach. Living in the realm of duality, we must have a good understanding of the absolute, which we may think of as a deity. But in Buddhism we do not have any particular idea about a deity. The absolute is the absolute because it is beyond our intellectual or dualistic thinking. We cannot deny this world of the absolute. Many people say that Buddhism is atheism because we have no particular idea of God. We know there is the absolute, but we know it is beyond the limit of our thinking mind, so we dont say so much about it. That is what we mean by an, darkness. Meichu ni atatte an ariIn the light there is darkness. This is a literal translation. But the literal translation doesnt Eighth Talkmake much sense. So we must understand the actual meaning of ari, there is. There are two characters for there is in Japanese: ari and zai. When we say that there is something on the table, or on the earth, or in Tassajarasomething on or in somethingwe use zai, and when we say, I have two hands, we use ari. Actually, we say, There are two hands, or In you there are two hands. Part of the character for ari means flesh or skin. This shows a very close relationship between light and darkness, like the relationship between my skin and myself. The English sentence In the light there is darkness sounds more dualistic. I have my skin, you may say, or I have my hand. But your hand or your skin is a part of you, so actually it is not dualistic. Skin is you yourself. Your hands are your hands. In English you say, I have two hands. But your hands may feel funny when you say this. Oh! We are a part of you, yet you say you have two hands. What do you mean Do you mean you have two more hands besides us If possible, I think there should be another way of expressing this in English. In these lines ari means there is a very close relationship between light and darkness. And actually darkness itself is light. Darkness or brightness is within your mind. In your mind you have some standard or measurement of how bright or dark this room is. If it is unusually bright, you may say the room is bright if it is unusually dark, you may say it is dark. But you can say, This room is bright, and at the same time, someone else may say, This room is very dark. Someone who comes from San Francisco at night may say, Oh, Tas Within Light There Is Utter Darknesssajara is very dark. But someone who comes here from a cave may say, Tassajara is very bright, like a capital city. The idea of light or dark is within ourselves. Because we have some standard we say light or dark, but actually light is darkness and darkness is light. Even though we say darkness, it does not mean that nothing is there. When you have light you can see many things, such as Caucasians and Japanese, men and women, stones and trees. These things appear in the light. When we say darkness or world of the absolute, which is beyond our thinking, you may think this is a world quite dierent from our human world, but this is also a mistake. If you understand darkness in that way, it is not the darkness meant here. Some of you are preparing food for Ed and Megs wedding. You may dish out various foods separately, putting them on dierent plates. This is soup, this is salad, this is dessert. That is the light. But when you eat, various foods will be mixed up in your tummy. Then there is no soup, no bread, no dessert. At that time they all work together. When the various items are on the plate, they are not yet working, so it is not yet actually food it is light. When it is in your tummy, it is darkness but even in darkness there is still lettuce and soup and everything. The food is the same only as it changes its form does it start to work. In utter darkness things happen that way. In light you feel good you feel as if you have a special dish in front of you, but the food is not serving its purpose yet. When you dont know what you are doing, actually you are acting fully, with a full mind. When you are thinking, you are Eighth Talknot yet working. When you start to work, both the dark side and the light side are there. When you are actually practicing the Buddhist way, there is a light side and a dark side, and the relationship between light and darkness is this ari relationship, like the relationship between skin and body. You cannot actually say which is skin and which is body. Anso wo motte o koto nakarebut dont take it as darkness. Nakare means do not. Motte means with. Anso means dark side or dark outlook. The character o means to meet, implying that you treat the person you meet as a friend. You meet or encounter the way clouds meet a mountain. Here is a Tassajara mountain, there are clouds, and the clouds from the ocean will meet the mountain. This kind of relationship is o. You should not meet people just with the understanding of darkness. If you meet your friend with your eyes shut, ignoring how old he is or how handsome he is, ignoring all his characteristics, you will not meet your friend. That is just a onesided understanding, because in the darkness there is light. Even though the relationship between you and your friend is very intimate, still your friend is who he is and you are you. Maybe the relationship is like husband and wife. Husband is husband and wife is wife that is a real relationship. Dont meet your friend without the understanding of light or duality. A close relationship is dark because, if your relationship is very close, you are one with the other person. But still you are you and your friend is who he is. The third and fourth lines here are parallel to the first and second. They say the same thing as the first and second, but Within Light There Is Utter Darknessin a dierent way. In the dark there is light, but dont see it as light. In darkness, even when we are in an intimate relationship, there is the duality of man and woman. This duality is the light. But you should not see others with the eyes of light only, because the other side of light is darkness. Darkness and light are two sides of one coin. We are liable to be caught by preconceived ideas. If you have a bad experience with somebody you may think, Oh, he is a bad person, he is always mean to me. But this may not be so. You are seeing him with the eyes of light only. You should know why he is mean to you. Because the relationship is so close, so intimate, it is more than a relationship between two persons. It is just one. So when he is angry, you will be angry. When one is angry, the other will be angry. You need to understand the other side of light, which is darkness. Then, even though you become angry, you will not feel so bad. Oh, he is so angry with me because he is so close to me. When you think he is bad it is dicult for you to change your idea of him. It may be true that sometimes he is bad, but right now you dont know whether he is good or bad. You have to see. We should not cling to the idea of darkness or light we should not cling to the idea of equality or dierentiation. Most people, once they have a grudge against someone, find it almost impossible to change their feeling. But if we are Buddhists we should be able to shift our minds from bad to good and from good to bad. If you are able to do so, bad does not mean bad, and good does not mean good anymore. But at the same time, good is good and bad is bad. Do you under Eighth Talkstand In this way we should understand the relationship between us. There is a poem:The mother is the blue mountain and the children are white clouds. All day long they are together, yet they do not knowwho is the mother and who are the children. The mountain is the mountain and the white clouds are white clouds floating around the mountain like children. There is the blue mountain and there are the white clouds, but they dont know that there are white clouds or blue mountains. Even though they dont know, they know very wellso well that they dont know. That is the experience you will have in your zazen practice. You will hear insects and the stream. You are sitting and the stream is running, and you hear it. Even though you hear it, you have no idea of stream and no idea of zazen. You are just on the black cushion. You are just there like a blue mountain with white clouds. This kind of relationship is fully explained in these four lines of the Sandokai.d i s c u s s i o nStudent: Roshi, which translation are you usingSuzuki Roshi: We are using several. A translation cannot be perfect. It is dicult, almost impossible, to translate because there are no exact equivalents. Ari here can mean nothing there is means there is not. Light means dark. ButWithin Light There Is Utter Darknesslight doesnt mean anything if it also means dark. That is why I said doubleedged earlier. Light Dark Which is it What is it But still there is both light and dark. There should not be any questions on this point, but if you have a question please ask meif you want to get hit! Laughing.Student: Roshi, what about focus You said that the clouds dont know theyre the children of the mountain and vice versa, but when we humans open and arrange our eating bowls, we focus on that without listening to the stream. It is a dierent activity.Suzuki Roshi: It is the same activity.Student: For me it is different.Suzuki Roshi: That is why you get the stick. Laughing. When you really focus there is light and darkness together, but when you are thinking about it there are two sides. Now you are asking a question. When you are asking a question you are thinking, so it is hard for me to answer your question. I may have to be very angry with you. That is the only way. If you get hit you will probably stop thinking about it.Student: Roshi, why do we shave our headsSuzuki Roshi: So that your thinking mind can go as smoothlyEighth Talkas this rubbing his shaved head with his hand. Bright darkvery smoothly. And to get rid of ornaments. We should not have anything that is not necessary.Student: The Diamond Sutra says that we suffer misfortune in this life because of sins or mistakes committed in past lives and that by suffering these misfortunes now, we will work out these mistakes or get retribution for them, atone for them, and open the way for enlightenment. It seems like a very heavy load. I dont understand it. It adds a new dimension to my problem.Suzuki Roshi: It will help. Because you suffer now does not mean that someone makes you suffer but that your suffering is caused by you yourself. If your understanding is like this you will have no complaints. But at the same time, if you understand your life just from the viewpoint of karma, the dualistic explanation of why we suffer, you are already caught by the idea of karma. We should be free from that onesided view. Even though we say karma, karma doesnt exist. But if karma doesnt exist, then you may say, Whatever I do, its all right. That means that you are caught by the idea of darkness. The other day we discussed why we kill earwigs. We have to kill them, but that doesnt mean that it is all right to kill them. It is not all right. We should understand our activity from both sides. If you dont feel so good about it, you should make more effort you should find out how to protect the vegetables without disturbing the earwigs. But you shouldWithin Light There Is Utter Darknessnot waste too much time or your practice will suffer. Anyway, you have to continue to find some good ideas one after another.Student: Roshi, what is the difference between understanding things or activities from both sides and not understanding them at allSuzuki Roshi: Ohtheres no need to talk about not understanding at all laughs. If you have a chance to listen to a lecture or read a book, you will understand something. Truth is truth. There are not two truths, only one. When you understand truth only with your mind, you may feel that is the truth. But compared to your actual activity or feeling or life, the truth that you understand with your mind is not the actual truth. Because our actual life is not as easy as our thinking, it is easy to be convinced that some idea we have is the perfect truth. Yet for us it is not true because that kind of thinking does not accord with our actual life. So there are two ways of understanding the truth. One way is intellectual truth. We understand, we say, but that understanding is just an intellectual understanding. Whether we understand it or not, truth is truthwhether Buddha appeared in this world or not, truth is truth. In the second way, something may be true for a buddha or an enlightened person, but for us it is not true. We cannot accept the fundamental truth as it is, so for us it does not seem true. That is the truth we work with in our practice. From the viewpoint of our practice, truth is not always true. Eighth TalkStudent: Although many practitioners in Buddhas time had attained samadhi, Buddha did not accept this samadhi until it was set round with equanimity. Is that what you just saidSuzuki Roshi: Yes. To stress some conception is not our way. We put more emphasis on our actual life. That is why we must practice. That all of us have buddha nature is true whether Buddha said it or not. But unfortunately most of us do not realize we have buddha nature. I dont know why.Student: When one comes to see the darkness in the light and the light in the darkness, do they finally become the same thing or do they always remain separately darkness and lightSuzuki Roshi: Yes, they are the same thing, but our lazy mind separates darkness from light. To plunge into the light, to find darkness in light, to find Buddha nature in perfect zazen is our way. Whether you are sleepy or not, good students or bad students, you should sit. That is the only way to have darkness in your bright dualistic practice. Samadhi Sanskrit or Pali, as commonly used by Buddhists, means profound meditation, a nondualistic state of consciousness in which subject and object are one, or the onepointedness of mind. n i n t h t a l kThe Willow TreeCannot Be Broken by the SnowLight and dark oppose one another like front and back foot in walking.We are still talking about reality from the viewpoint of independency. Dependency and independency are actually two sides of one coin. People may say that the Japanese are very tough. But that is just one side of the Japanese personality. The other side is softness. Because of their Buddhist background, they have been trained that way for a long time. The Japanese people are very kind. We have a childrens song that describes a hero called Momotaro, the Peach Boy. There was an old couple who lived near the riverside. One day the old woman picked up a peach from the stream and came back to her home. And from the peach, out came Momotaro. The Japanese children sing a song about him: He was very strong but very kind and gentle. He is the ideal Japanese character. What do you call it You must have some expression for it.Student: Folk hero Yes, folk hero. Without a soft mind you cannot be really strong. If Momotaro did not have this side of his character, Ninth Talkif he was not very sympathetic, he could not be really strong. A person who is strong just for himself is not so strong, but a strong person who is very kind will support people and can really be a folk hero. When we have both a soft side and a strong side, we can be strong in a real way. It may be easier to fight and win than to endure without crying when you are defeated. You should be able to allow your foe to beat you, okay This is very dicult. But unless you can endure the bitterness of defeat, you cannot be really strong. Readiness to be weak can be a sign of strength. We say, The willow tree cannot be broken by the snow. The weight of the snow may break a strong trees branches. But with a willow, though the snow may bend or twist the branches, even a heavy snow like the one we had last year cannot break them. Bamboo also bends easily. It looks quite weak, but no snow can break it. Like front and back foot in walking. Darkness and brightnessabsolute and relativeare a pair of opposites, like front and back feet when we walk. This is a very good way of explaining oneness, or the actual function of a pair of opposites. It expresses how we apply pairs of opposites, like delusion and enlightenment, reality and idea, good and bad, weak and strong, in our everyday practice. People who feel they are strong may find it dicult to be weak. People who feel they are weak may never try to be strong. That is quite usual. But sometimes we should be strong and sometimes we should be weak. If you remain weak always or if you always want to be strong, then you cannot be strong in the true sense. The Willow Tree Cannot Be Broken When you learn something, you should be able to teach it to people. You should put the same effort into teaching as into learning. And if you want to teach, you should be humble enough to learn something. Then you can teach. If you try to teach just because you know something, you cannot teach anything. When you are ready to be taught by someone, then, if necessary, you can teach people in the true sense of the word. So, to learn is to teach and to teach is to learn. If you think you are always a student, you cannot learn anything. The reason you learn something is in order to teach others after you have learned it. There is no fixed moral standard rather, you find your moral code when you try to teach others. Before Japan was defeated in the war and surrendered unconditionally, the Japanese people thought they had a moral teaching that was absolutely right. If they only observed that code, they believed, they would not make any mistakes. But that moral code, unfortunately, was set up at the beginning of the Meiji period . After losing the war, they lost confidence in their morality and didnt know what kind of morals they should observe. They didnt know what to do. But actually it shouldnt be so dicult to find ones moral code. I said to people at that time, You have children. When you raise them, you will naturally know the moral code for yourself. When you think the moral code is just for yourself, that is a onesided understanding. A moral code is, rather, to help others. The moral code you find when you want to help and be kind to others will naturally be good for you as well. Ninth Talk It is said, To go east one hundred miles is to go west one hundred miles. When the moon is high in the sky, the moon in the water will be deep. But usually people will observe the moon above the water and not see the moon in the water. That the moon is deep means that the moon is high. The moon in the water is independent and the moon over the water is independent but the moon over the water is also the moon in the water. We should understand this. When you are strong, you should be strong. You should be very tough. But that toughness comes from your gentle kindness. When you are kind, you should just be kind. But that does not mean you are not strong. Women may not be physically as strong as men. Because of that they are often stronger than men. Actually, we dont know who is stronger. When we have our own completely independent nature, our strength is absolutely equal with everyone elses. If you are involved in comparing who is stronger, you or , then you dont have real strength. When you are completely independent, one with your own nature, you are an absolute power in a relative situation. When dierent kinds of people are competing with each other, they are not so strong. When each becomes completely himself or herself, they have absolute power. Do you understand this point So light and darkness, although they are a pair of opposites, are equal, as when one footstep is ahead and the other is behind. When you walk, the step ahead immediately becomes the step behind. Is a step with your right foot the step ahead or the step behind Which is it Which is brightness and which is darkness It is dicult to tell. The Willow Tree Cannot Be Broken When you are walking, there is no foot ahead or behind. If you stop walking and think about it, sometimes the right foot may be ahead and the left foot may be behind. But when your feet are actually walking, when you are actually practicing the way, there is no light or darkness, no foot ahead or foot behind. If I say that you should just sit zazen without thinking, you may feel that you should not have any thoughts. You will be caught by the idea that the right foot is ahead and the left foot is behind. Then you cannot walk anymore. When you are actually walking, you have no idea of left foot or right foot. But if you are selfconsciously aware of right foot or left foot, you cannot walk or run. As I have said, before you chew your food there is rice, pickle, and soup. When you have chewed your food there is no rice, no pickle, no soup. After you mix the food in your mouth, it will be digested in your tummy, and it will serve its purpose. Even so, we should serve one thing after another, and dessert should come last. There is an order. But even though there is an order, you should chew your food and mix it, or else the food will not serve its purpose. It is necessary to think about it, to have a recipe, but it is also necessary to chew and mix everything up. This is a very good interpretation of reality and a good illustration of how we practice our way and of the kind of activity that is going on in our everyday lives. With these lines, Sekitos interpretation of reality in the light of independency is completed. Ninth Talkd i s c u s s i o nFirst Student: Roshi, when you say independency, Im confused as to whether you mean independence or interdependency.Suzuki Roshi: Independency. Excuse me. Interdependency is more like dependency.Another Student: We have the noun dependency, so we can have independency.Suzuki Roshi: But do you have independencyFirst Student: Now we have independency!Suzuki Roshi: Independent is too strong. If you are independentstriking the table with his stickthats all! You dont care about anything. That is not what we mean. When you are independent, you are in a very vulnerable or dangerous situation.Student: People think they are independent. Isnt this a delusionSuzuki Roshi: Yes. When they think, I am independent, it is not true. You are dependent on everything.Student: I cant figure out how you can tell the difference between what a woman is supposed to be and what a man is supposed to be. If a woman competes with a man someone mayThe Willow Tree Cannot Be Brokensay shes weak, but how do you know what a woman or a man is supposed to be like in the first placeSuzuki Roshi: I dont mean weak. If men and women compete and are compared with each other by setting up some standards or categories, sometimes the man will be stronger and sometimes the woman will be stronger. Anyway, you cannot always be strong. But when you become yourself, a woman or a man absolutely, you have absolute value always and no one can replace you.Student: I have some trouble with the relevancy of this lecture. Id like you to say one more thing about it, but I dont know what. I cant quite see what its all about. I do understand what its about when you are talking about opposites and things like that.Suzuki Roshi: The purpose of what I am saying is to open a dierent approach to your understanding of reality. You are observing things from just one side or the other, and you stick to some onesided understanding. That is why I am talking in this way. It is necessary. Strictly speaking, Buddhists have no teaching. We have no God or deities. We dont have anything. What we have is nothingness, thats all. So how is it possible for Buddhists to be religious What kind of composure do we have That will be the question. The answer is not some special idea of God or a deity, but rather, the understanding of the reality we Ninth Talkare always facing. Where are we What are we doing Who is he Who is she When we observe things in this way, we dont need a special teaching about God because everything is God for us. Moment after moment we are facing God. And each one of us is also God or Buddha. So we dont need any special idea of God. That may be the point.Student: Roshi, that sounds very good to me, but then why do we take vows For instance, when Ed and Meg got married, you said they should take refuge in the Triple Treasure Buddha, Dharma, Sangha and observe the ten cardinal precepts.Suzuki Roshi: We take vows and observe precepts, and we read sutras. But even though you read scriptures and observe precepts, without right understanding they will be precepts of either light or darkness, and when you are caught in this way or rely too much on precepts or scriptures, they will not be Buddhist precepts or scriptures any more.Student: Suppose I take a precept that says not to speak ill of others. If I dont follow the precept, it seems like there is no reason for it at all, and if I do follow it, it seems like Im being caught by it. I just dont understand. If precepts are not rigid, they dont seem to be of any use at all, and if they are rigid, they dont seem to be consistent with the Sandokai. I have always wondered about that part in the meal chant where we say, to avoid all evil and practice good. I asked you about it, and you said that we should just pay attention to The Willow Tree Cannot Be Brokenwhat we are doing. If that is so, why dont we just say that Why dont we say, I vow to practice zazen in my everyday life and not be caught by rules Why go through this good and evil thing Its kind of phony.Suzuki Roshi: Nooo. You are just trying to argue with me, thats all. Laughing. You need precepts, but actually it isnt possible to violate precepts. You cannot. But you feel as if you are. If you feel that way, you should accept your feelings, and if you accept your feelings then you have to say, excuse me, or Im sorry, or something. That is also quite natural. Dont kill is a dead precept. Excuse me is an actual working precept, which is not one foot behind or one foot forward. Do you understand If you read the precepts and say, Okay, I will do it, that is precepts. And when you have violated a precept, you may say, Oh, excuse me. That is quite natural.Student: Some of the precepts do feel naturalfor instance, that I shouldnt say nasty things about people. But the precept about taking harmful drugs or intoxicants seems unnatural. If all the precepts were natural and I just wanted to do things naturally, then that would make more sense to me.Suzuki Roshi: If you feel like that, you might also say, It is quite natural for me to be born and live in this world. But is it natural You have already assumed something that you shouldnt assume. Why did you come here That may already be a big mistake. Laughing.Student: When I came here they didnt ask me about precepts.They just wanted to know if I had . a day.Suzuki Roshi: Good bargain. But it cannot be so simple. AnyNinth Talkway, you should say, Oh, Im sorry. When you are born you cannot say so. Now you can. So you should say, I am sorry to be your daughter or your son. Excuse me. I have caused you a lot of trouble. That is actually following the precepts.Student: Roshi, sometimes I feel this way about listening to lectures: Once I was just walking along and someone came and said, Did you realize that when you are walking, one foot is ahead and the other is behind No! For a long time that amazed me. I wondered why he ever asked me a question like that, and I thought about it a lot. It was a very strange thing, and it occupied my attention. After a long time, I found that I was just walking again and didnt think so much about it. But one day as I was walking, another man came up and said, Did you realize that when you are walking, one foot is ahead and the other is behind And I feel at that point now. I still dont understand it at all, but I have to deal with it somehow. Half of me says, Whats the relevance of it because it doesnt bother me anymore, and the other half says, Yes, but its still happening like that every time I take a step.Suzuki Roshi: If you think of your life only as a personal practice, it doesnt make much sense. But if you are aware of what we human beings are doing, you will see that this is exactly how we cause trouble for ourselves. Right foot or left foot, Rinzai or Soto, America or the Soviet Union, peace or war if your understanding is like this, it is a big problem. The way to solve it is to walk on and on and on.The Willow Tree Cannot Be BrokenStudent: Do I understand you to say that the problem is how to be aware of all these polarities and precepts without being conscious of being aware Selfconsciousness sort of fixes things, and that is not real either. It fixes the chain.Suzuki Roshi: Yes, when the chain is fixed, it cannot move. But still you should move. Time does not wait for you, so you should go on and on following reality. If you think about this point, you will already have started to walk. But if you just remain thinking about it, it doesnt work and you are not walking forward. If you think, The world is going on and on, we are becoming older and older, today will not come again, and tomorrow I have to go somewhere, you have already started to walk. You cannot think the same thing always you cannot always stop and think. You should just go on and on, making your best effort. And when you make your best effort, you are actually walking. Sometimes one foot may be behind and sometimes it may be ahead. Sometimes you feel as if you are doing something good and sometimes you feel as if you are doing something bad. But you have to accept that you are going on and on and on that way. Since you have to accept it, and since you have to live in each moment, then you are actually living in each moment. Then you should do something, say something. Say something! the Rinzai master shouts. Say something now! Strikes the table with his stick. What do you say That is the point.t e n t h t a l kSuering Is a Valuable ThingEach of the myriad things has its merit, expressed according to function and place. Phenomena exist, like box and lid joining principle accords, like arrow points meeting.Now I would like to talk about how we observe things, how we should treat things, and how we understand the value of things. Each of the myriad things has its merit, expressed according to function and placeBammotsu onozukara ko ari, masani yo to sho to wo iu beshi. The myriad things bammotsu include human beings, mountains and rivers, stars and planets. Everything has its own function, virtue, or value. When we say value, usually we mean exchange value. But here value has a wider meaning, for which we use the word ko. Ko does not mean function or utility in the usual sense, but instead it applies more to virtue or merit: someone living a meritorious life or doing something for society or the community. That function will have virtue for us. But when we say function, you may still wonder, Function of what Here I will have to use some technical terms. For instance, if you see somethingThe sound system suddenly is turned up and Roshi hears his own voice coming back from the loudspeakers. Oh! Laughter. You hear my voice. You think you Tenth Talkare listening to me. What you are listening to may be my voice, but actually you are listening to the function of some universal entity called electricity that covers the whole worldthe whole universe. This is one understanding. Another would be that you are listening to my nature as well as the nature of electricity. So when you see or listen to something, the whole universe is included. When we understand things in this way, we call it the understanding of tai. Tai means body. But it is a big, ontological body that includes everything. And we call the nature of that body sho not the sho in these lines of text here, but the sho that means the basic nature of everything. When we grasp that which is beyond words, we call that understanding ri, or truth. Ri is something beyond our idea of good and bad, long and short, right and wrong. In the next line we have yo, which means utility or usage. Ko and yo may seem the same, but herewhen used as Buddhist technical termsko refers to the function of things, or ji, while yo refers to the function of absolute truth, or ri. In these two lines, Sekito is talking about the oneness of ko and yo. Ko and yo apply to each occasion and to every thing. So when you encounter things, you should know that right there the true teaching reveals itself. You should know that place. Sometimes we use ko and yo together. When we say koyo, we understand not only each thing just as we see it, but also the background of each thing, which is ri. We should know how to use things. To know how to use things is to know the teaching, or the way things are functioning. To understand Suering Is a Valuable Thingthings means to understand the background and to understand the value of things is to understand how to use them in the right way according to the place and the nature of each thing. This is to see thingsasitis. Usually, even though you say, I see thingsasitis, you dont. You see one side of reality and not the other. You dont see the background, which is ri you only see things in terms of ji, the phenomenal side of each event, and you think each thing exists only in that way, but it is not so. All things are changing and are related, one to another, and each thing has its background. There is a reason why all things are here. To see thingsasitis means to understand that ji and ri are one, that distinction and equality are one, and that the application of the truth and the value of things are one. For instance, we think the universe is only for human beings. Nowadays our ideas have become wider, and our way of understanding things has become freer, but even so, our understanding is mostly humancentered, so we dont see or appreciate the true value of things. You have many questions to ask me, but if you understand this point clearly, there is not much to ask. Most questions and problems are created by humancentered, selfish ideas. What is birth and death That is already a very selfcentered idea. Of course, birth and death are our virtue or merit. To die is our virtue to come into this world is also our virtue. We see how things are going, how everything is appearing and disappearing, becoming older and older, or growing bigger and bigger. Everything exists in this way. So why should we treat ourselves in a special way Tenth TalkWhen we say birth and death, we mostly mean the birth and death of human beings. When you understand birth and death as the birth and death of everythingplants, animals, and treesit is not a problem anymore. If it is a problem, it is a problem for everything, including us. A problem for everything is not a problem anymore. Almost all of these questions come from a narrow understanding of things. A wider, clearer understanding is necessary. You may think that talking about this kind of thing will not help you at all. For a selfish human being, it may be hard to be helped. Buddhism does not treat human beings as a special category. It is deluded and egotistical to put human beings into a special category. Yet it is normal for humans to think that way, not reflecting within but seeking some truth outside themselves. When you look for the truth outside, it means the background is not big enough. You need to find some confidence within yourself. The Sandokai says here that all beings have their own virtue or merit. As human beings, we have our own nature. Only when we live like human beings, who have a selfish human nature, are we following the truth in its greater sense, because then we are taking our nature into account. So we should live like human beings in this world. We should not try to live like cats and dogs, who have more freedom and are less selfish. Human beings should be put into a cage, a big invisible cage like religion or morality. Dogs and cats have no such special cage. They dont need any teaching or religion. But we human beings need religion. We human beings should say ex Suering Is a Valuable Thingcuse me, but dogs and cats dont need to. So we human beings should follow our way, and dogs and cats should follow their way. This is how the truth applies to everything. If we observe our human way, and dogs and cats observe their animal ways, it looks as if humans and animals have different natures. But although our natures are dierent, the background is the same. Because where we live and the way we live is dierent, the application of the truth should be different. It is like the way we use electricity. Sometimes we use it as a light and sometimes as a loudspeaker. Human beings have their nature and animals have their nature. But even though our ways of expressing our natures are dierent, our natures have the same basis. That is the application of the truth. This is actually what Sekito is talking about. We should not be attached to the difference in usage, because we are using the same true nature, or buddha nature. But according to the situation, we will use buddha nature in dierent ways. That is how to find the true nature within ourselves in everyday life. The next two lines are: Phenomena exist, like box and lid joining principle accords, like arrow points meeting.The relative ji fits the absolute rilike a box and its lid. The absolute and relative accord like two arrow points meeting. As I said before, ji means various things and events, including things you have in your mind, the things you think about. Ri is something beyond thinking, beyond our understanding or perception. Again, relative and absolute are the same thing, but we must understand them in two ways.Where there is ji, there is ri. Like a box and its lid, they fitTenth Talktogether. That I am here means that the true buddha nature is here. At the moment, I am an expression of buddha nature. I am not just . It is more than , but I am expressing true nature in my own way. That I am here means that the whole universe is here, just as where there is a kerosene lamp there is oil. The way ri accords with ji is like two arrows meeting in midair. There is an old story about this. In China, in the Warring States Period b.c.e., there was a famous archery master named Hiei Ch. Feiwei. Kisho Ch. Jichang, another very good archer, became ambitious and wanted to compete with Hiei. So he waited with his bow and arrow for Hiei to come. Seeing Kisho arrive, Hiei raised his bow and arrow. He tried to hit Kisho first, but both of them were so good and quick that the arrows met in the air. Ssst! Afterward they became like father and son. There is some reason, for instance, that I am old. Without a reason, I would not have become old. And without a reason, I wouldnt have been a youth. For some reason, I became old, so I cannot complain. The background of my being old is the background of my being raised as a beautiful boy. Laughing. I am supported by the same background, and I shall also be supported by it even when I die. That is our understanding. To accept thingsasitis looks very dicult, but it is very easy. If you dont find it easy, you should think about why it is dicult. Maybe, you may say, it is because of the shallow, selfish understanding I have of myself. And then you may ask, Why do I have a selfish understanding of things Suering Is a Valuable ThingBut a selfish understanding of things is also necessary. Because we are selfish, we work hard. Without a selfish understanding, we cannot work. We always need some candy, and a selfish understanding is a kind of candy. It is not something to be rejected, but something that helps you. You should be grateful for your selfish understanding, which creates many questions. They are just questions and they dont mean so much. You can enjoy your questions and answers you can play games with them you neednt be so serious about it. That is the understanding of the Middle Way. We can understand the Middle Way as ri, emptiness, and ji, somethingness. Both are necessary. Because we are human beings and our destiny is to live for possibly eighty or ninety years, we must have a selfish way of life. Because we have a selfish way of life, we will have difficulties that we should accept. When we accept difficulties, that itself is the Middle Way. Without rejecting your selfish way of life, you must accept itbut dont stick to it! Just enjoy your human life as long as you live. That is the Middle Way, the understanding of ri and ji. When there is ri, there is ji when there is ji, there is ri. To understand difficulty in this way is to enjoy your life without rejecting problems or suffering. I noticed something very important that I have not emphasized so much before: suffering is a valuable thing. I understood this today when I was discussing it with someone. Our practice could be the practice of suffering. How we suffer will be our practice. It helps a lot. I think most of you know suffering, as you have pain in your legs when you sit. And in every Tenth Talkday life you have suffering. Bishop Yamada led some sesshins at Zen Center. He emphasized unshu, which Hakuin Zenji had practiced for a long time. Hakuin had suffered from consumption when he was young, and he conquered his illness by the practice of unshu, which means putting emphasis on the outbreathmmmmmm. How do you say itStudent: GroanGroan When you suffer, you say mmmmmm.Student: SighNo, not sigh.Student: MoanMoanno. More strengthlike a tiger in pain.Student: Growl Growl Laughing. He said your breathing should be like the breathing you have when you suffer. You should put more strength in your lower abdomen and take a long time exhaling. You should practice mmmmmm silently otherwise, it is not unshu. When you repeat this unshu as if you are suffering from something physically or mentally, and you direct your Reirin Yamada was Soto Zen bishop of North America from to . Hakuin Zenji was an important Japanese Zen master who revitalized and systematized the Rinzai school. His breathing practices are described in the autobiographical essay Yasenkanna, reprinted in Trevor Leggetts The Tigers Cave London: Rider and Company, , pp. . Suering Is a Valuable Thingpractice just to the suffering you have, then that can be a good practice. It does not dier from shikantaza. But when your suffering is centered in your chest and your breathing is shallow, this is agony. When you suffer completely, you should suffer from your lower abdomen. Mmmmmm. You feel good when you do that. It is much better than saying nothing or just lying down. Bishop Yamada had difficulty until quite recently. Now he is, maybe, over the cloud. But when he was in Los Angeles, he suffered a lot. At that time, I hadnt had much experience of illness and couldnt understand. I couldnt accept his practice of unshu like a sick person might. Mmmmmm. What is that practice I thought. But I found out why he did it, and I found out that it helps a lot. Of course, he understood what suffering is. No one enjoys suffering, but our human destiny is to have suffering. How we suffer is the point. We should know how to accept our human suffering, but we should not be completely caught by it. Maybe that was Bishop Yamadas practice. To find the oneness of ri and ji, the oneness of joy and suffering, the oneness of the joy of enlightenment within difficulty, is our practice. This is called the Middle Way. Do you understand Where there is suffering, there is the joy of suffering, or nirvana. Even in nirvana, you cannot get out of suffering. We say nirvana is the complete extinction of desires, but what Shikantaza means just sitting. That is, over his suffering.Tenth Talkthat means is to have this complete understanding and to live according to it. That is zazen. You are sitting upright. You are not leaning over to the side of nirvana or leaning over to the side of suffering. You are right here. Everyone can sit up and practice zazen. I am following Sekitos poem line by line, but actually it is necessary to read it straight through from beginning to end. If you talk about it piece by piece, it doesnt make much sense. Sekito is very strict in the conclusion, very strict. You cannot escape from him. You cannot say anything or else you will feel his big stick. In his time, the Zen world was too noisy, so he became very angry. Shut up! is what he said, actually. So I shouldnt talk so long. Maybe its already been too long. Excuse me. a s h o r t t a l k d u r i n g z a z e nPresented during zazen on the morning of June , , between the tenth and eleventh Sandokai talks.You should sit with your whole body: your spine, mouth, toes, mudra. Check on your posture during zazen. Each part of your body should practice zazen independently or separately: your toes should practice zazen independently, and your mudra should practice zazen independently, and your spine and your mouth should practice zazen independently. You should feel each part of your body doing zazen independently. Each part of your body should participate completely in zazen. Check to see that each part of your body is doing zazen independently this is also known as shikantaza. To think I am doing zazen or my body is doing zazen is wrong understanding. It is a selfcentered idea. The mudra is especially important. You should not feel as if you are resting your mudra on the heel of your foot for your own convenience. Your mudra should be placed in its own position. In zazen, mudra refers to the position of the hands, which form a circle called the cosmic mudra. A Short Talk during Zazen Dont move your legs for your own convenience. Your legs are practicing their own zazen independently and are completely involved in their own pain. They are doing zazen through pain. You should allow them to practice their own zazen. If you think you are practicing zazen, you are involved in a selfish, egotistical idea. If you think that you have a difficulty in some part of your body, then the rest of the body should help the part that is in difficulty. You are not having difficulty with some part of your body, but the part of the body is having difficulty: for example, your mudra is having difficulty. Your whole body should help your mudra do zazen. The entire universe is doing zazen in the same way that your body is doing zazen. When all parts of your body are practicing zazen, then that is how the whole universe practices zazen. Each mountain is standing and each river is flowing independently. All parts of the universe are participating in their practice. The mountain practices independently. The river practices independently. Thus the whole universe practices independently. When you see something, you may think that you are watching something outside yourself. But, actually, you are watching your mudra, or your toe. That is why zazen represents the whole universe. We should do zazen with this feeling in our practice. You should not say, I practice zazen with my body. It is not so. Dogen Zenji says, Water does not flow, but the bridge flows. You may say that your mind is practicing zazen and A Short Talk during Zazenignore the practice of your body. Sometimes when you think that you are doing zazen with an imperturbable mind, you ignore the body, but it is also necessary to have the opposite understanding at the same time. Your body is practicing zazen in imperturbability while your mind is moving. Your legs are practicing zazen with pain. Water is practicing zazen with movement, yet the water is still while flowing because flowing is its stillness, or its nature. The bridge is doing zazen without moving. Let the water flow, as this is the waters practice. Let the bridge stay and sit there, because that is the actual practice of the bridge. The bridge is practicing zazen painful legs are practicing zazen imperturbable zazen is practicing zazen. This is our practice. e l e v e n t h t a l kWe Should Not Stickto Words or Rules Too MuchHearing the words, understand the meaning dont set up standards of your own.If you dont understand the way right before you, how will you know the path as you walkHearing the words, understand the meaningKoto wo uke te wa subekaraku shu wo esu beshi. Koto means words. Koto also includes everything: words, things, and ideas that we see or hear. Uke te means to receive or to listen to. Shu is the source of teaching, which is beyond words. When you listen to the words, you should understand the source of the teaching. Usually we stick to words, so it is dicult to see the true meaning of the teaching. We say that the words or the teaching is the finger pointing at the moon. Words just suggest the real meaning of the truth. If you stick to the finger pointing at the moon, you cannot see the moon. We should not stick to words, but should know the actual meaning of the words. In Sekitos time each master had his own way of introducing the real teaching to his disciples. As students stuck to their teachers words or particular ways, Zen became divided into many schools, and it was hard for the students to know which was the true way. Actually, to wonder which was the true way Eleventh Talkwas already wrong. Each teacher was suggesting the true teaching, in his own way, from the same source that was transmitted from Buddha. To stick to words without knowing the source of the teaching is wrong, and that is what many teachers and students of Sekitos time were doing. So Sekito is saying here: If you receive words, you should understand the source of the teaching that is transmitted from Buddha and is beyond each teachers own way of expressing or suggesting the truth. The next sentence is, Dont set up standards of your own. You should not establish rules for yourself you should not stick to rules or be bound by them. Most people are doing that. When you say This is right! or This is wrong! you establish some rules for yourself. And because you say so, naturally you will stick to them and be bound by them. That is why Zen was divided into many ways or schoolsSoto, Rinzai, Obaku, Ummon, Hogen, and Igyo. Originally there was one teaching, but each teacher or his disciples established a school, and they stuck to their family way and were bound by it. They understood Buddhas teaching in their own way, and then stuck to their understanding and thought that it was Buddhas teaching. In other words, they stuck to the finger pointing at the moon. If three teachers are pointing at the moon, each has his own finger, and so there are already three schools. But the moon is one. So Sekito says dont establish your own rules for yourself. This is very important for our practice. We are liable to establish our own rules. This is the rule of Tassajara, you may We Should Not Stick to Words or Rulessay. But rules are the finger that points to how we have good practice at Tassajara according to the situation. Rules are important, but you shouldnt think: This is the only way, Our rules are true permanent teaching, or Their rules are wrong. You shouldnt stick to your own understanding of things. Something that is good for one person is not always good for another. So you should not make rules for everyone. Rules are important, but dont stick to rules and force them on others. When you enter a monastery you shouldnt say, I have my own way. If you come to Tassajara you should obey Tassajaras rules. You should not establish your own rules. To see the actual moon through Tassajara rules is the way to practice at Tassajara. Rules are not the point. The teaching that the rules will catch is the point. By observing rules you will naturally understand the real teaching. From the beginning this point may be missed by all of us. Most people start to study Zen in order to know what Zen is. This is already wrong. They are always trying to provide some understanding or rules for themselves. The way to study Zen should be like the way a fish picks up its food. It does not try to catch anything. It just swims around. And if something good comessnap! Even though it is very hot, you are observing Tassajara rules, eating in the hot zendo like a fish swimming around, and if something good comessnap! As you are doing so, you will get something. I dont know whether you realize it or not, but as long as you are following the rules, you will have something. Even though Eleventh Talkyou dont have anything or study anything, you are actually studying, like a fish who doesnt seem to know what he is eating. Thats all. We should study Zen in that way. To understand does not mean to understand something through your head. If you ask the question What is good of a Zen student, his answer may be Something you should do is good, and something you shouldnt do is bad. Thats all. We dont think so much about good or bad. Dogen Zenji says, The power of should not is good. This is something intuitive, the very inmost function of ourselves, our innate nature. Our innate nature has its own function before you say good or bad. It appears to be sometimes good and sometimes bad. This is our understanding. But our innate nature is beyond the idea of good or bad. Wondering why we practice zazen in such hot weather leads to confusion. We should be like a fish, always swimming around in the river. That is a Zen student. Dogen Zenji said, The bird does not need to know the limit of the sky or what the sky is before flying in it. Birds just fly in the big sky. That is how we practice zazen. So you should not try to make rules for yourself. These are very strict words. They may not seem to mean much, but actually when Sekito Zenji says this, he is waiting with a big stick. If you say something, he answers, Dont make rules for yourself! Dont try to understand through your head! He is waiting like this! Suzuki Roshi holds up a stick as if ready to strike. So we cannot say anything. Hai! Yes!thats all. We Should Not Stick to Words or RulesYou neednt even say hai! You should do things like a mule or an ass. You may think this is absolute surrender, but it is not. It is the way to understand the source of the teaching. We are likely to wonder what the source is. It is not something you can understand through words, but something you have when you do things quite naturally and intuitively without saying good or bad. Time is going on and on, and we do not have time to say good or bad. Moment after moment we should follow the flow of time. You should go with time. When you become tired of doing something, you may talk about this way or that way, just to kill time. But when you see that the vegetables in the garden have almost dried up in the hot weather, you do not have much time to discuss what is the appropriate thing to do today. While discussing it, you are becoming more and more hungry. So the kitchen people should go to the kitchen and prepare food for the next meal. That is the most important thing. This does not mean that it is a waste of time to think about things. It is good to think about things, but we should not stick to words or rules too much. This is a very delicate point. Without ignoring rules, and without sticking to rules, we should continue our Tassajara practice. This is what Sekito is suggesting. And then he says, If you dont understand the way right before you, how will you know the path as you walk The only way is to use your five sense organs wherever you go and simultaneously to understand the source of the teaching. If Eleventh Talkyou dont do this, even though you move your feet or practice you cannot know the true way. So the most important thing is not rules but finding the true source of the teaching with your eyes and ears wherever you are. This is a direct way to know the source of the teaching, without trying to establish some particular way for yourself. If you stick to words, if you do not see the true way through your own eyes, ears, nose, and tongue, if you stick to rules and ignore the direct experience of everyday life, then even though you practice zazen, it doesnt work. To have some direct experience of everyday life without thinking Rinzai or Soto, this way or that way, is the most important thing. That is how we understand the true source of the teaching transmitted from Buddha. The true way could be a stick. The original way of Buddha could be a stone. As Master Ummon said, it may be toilet paper. What is the true way What is Buddha Buddha is something beyond our understanding. Buddha could be anything. Instead of the word Buddha we could just say toilet paper, or three pounds of hemp, as Tozan did. So if someone asks you, Who is Buddha the answer may be You are Buddha too. If someone asks, What is the mountain you may reply, The mountain is also Buddha. In Japanese we say mo mataalso. You shouldnt say simply, This is Buddha. That statement will lead to some misunderstanding. But if you say, This is also Buddha, it is okay. If someone asks, Where is Buddha you may say, Here is Buddha too. Too is not so definite. Buddha may be somewhere else too. We Should Not Stick to Words or Rules The secret of the perfect Zen statement is It is not always so. As long as you are at Tassajara, this is our rule, but it is not always so. You shouldnt forget this point. This is also Buddhas rule. If you know this, there is no danger and you will not invite any misunderstanding. This is how you become free of selfish practice. Even though you think you are practicing Buddhas way, you are liable to be involved in selfish practice when you say, The way should be like this. You should definitely say, This is our Tassajara way. But you should be ready to accept some other way too. This is rather dicultto have a very strict, strong confidence in your own practice and to be flexible enough to accept anothers way too. You may feel that to be ready to accept anothers teaching is not a strict way. But unless you are ready to accept anothers practice, you cannot be so strict with your own. Strictness may become just stubbornness. Only when you are ready to accept someones opinion can you say, You should do so! When other people come, we can observe their way. Otherwise, you cannot be so strict with yourself. Usually strictness means to be rigid, to be caught by your own understanding and not to provide room for the understanding of others. If someone asked my masters opinion about some matter, he always said, If you ask me, my opinion is this! Suzuki Roshi hits the table with his stick. When he said so, he was very strong. He could be so strong because he said, If you ask me. That is our way. To be just yourself is to be ready to accept someone elses opinion too. Each moment you should intuitively know what to do. But this does not mean you should reject the opinions of others. Eleventh Talk In everyday life there is dao, the way, and if you do not practice in the midst of everyday activity, there is no approach to the true way. That is what Sekito means. Dont stick to words. Dont make your own rules and force rules on others. It is not possible to force rules on others anyway, because each person has his own way and should have his own way. t w e l f t h t a l kDo Not Pass Your Days and Nights in VainPractice is not a matter of far or near,but if you are confused, mountains and rivers block your way. I respectfully urge you who study the mystery, dont pass your days and nights in vain.Practice is not a matter of far or near. This is very important. When you are involved in selfish practice you have some idea of attainment. When you strive to reach a goal or attain enlightenment, you naturally have the idea I am far from the goal, or I am almost there. But if you really practice our way, enlightenment is right where you are. This may be rather dicult to accept. When you practice zazen without any idea of attainment, there is actually enlightenment. Dogen Zenji explained that in selfcentered practice, there is enlightenment and there is practice: practice and enlightenment are events that we will encounter in our life. But when we realize practice and enlightenment as events that appear in the realm of the great dharma world, then enlightenment is an event that expresses the dharma world, and practice is also an event that expresses the dharma world. If both express or suggest the big dharma world, then actually there is no need to be discouraged if we do not attain enlightenment. Nor should we be extremely happy if we do attain it, because there is no difference. Practice and enlightenment have equal value. Twelfth Talk If enlightenment is important, practice is also important. When we understand this point within each step, we have enlightenment. But there will be no need to be excited about it. Step by step we will continue endless practice, appreciating the bliss of the dharma world. That is practice based on enlightenment, practice beyond our experience of good or bad, beyond selfcentered practice. In the last lecture I discussed Sekitos statement, If you dont understand the way right before you, how will you know the path as you walk Whatever you see, that is the dao. Even though you practice, if you do not understand this, your practice will not work. Now he says that if you practice our way in its true sense, there is no problem about being far away from the goal or almost there. A beginners practice and a great Zen masters practice are not dierent. But if you are involved only in selfcentered practice, that is delusion. In the next line he says that if you practice our way with a dualistic sense of practice and enlightenment, then you will be separated from the dao by difficulties as great as those of crossing mountains and rivers. Then he says, I respectfully urge you who study the mystery, do not pass your days and nights in vainKoin munashiku wataru koto nakare. Ko here means sunbeam and in means shadow, so koin means day and night or time.Wataru means to spend or to pass. Nakare means not, and munashiku is in vain. Do not pass your days and nights in vain means Dont goof o.Even though you work very hard sometimes, you may beDo Not Pass Your Days and Nights in Vainspending your valuable time without actually doing anything. If you dont know what you are doing, we may say, Oh, you are passing your time in vain. You may say, No, Im striving very hard to put ten thousand dollars into my savings account, but to us that may not make much sense. Even though you work very hard at Tassajara during the work period, it does not always mean that you are doing the right thing. If you goof o you are wasting your time, and even if you work very hard, maybe you are also wasting your time. This is a kind of koan for you. Every day is a good day. This famous koan doesnt mean that you shouldnt complain if you have some difficulty. What it means is Dont spend your time in vain. I think most people are spending their time in vain. No, Im always busy, they may say. But if they say so, it is a sure sign that they are spending their time in vain. Most people do things with some feeling of purpose, as if they know what they are doing. But even so, I dont think they have a proper understanding of their activity. When you do something with a purpose based on some evaluation of what is useful or useless, good or bad, more or less valuable, your understanding is not perfect. If you do things that need to be done regardless of whether the results are good or bad, successful or unsuccessful, that is real practice. If you do things not because of Buddha, or truth, or yourself, or others, but for the things themselves, that is the true way.I cannot explain this so well. Maybe I shouldnt explain soTwelfth Talkmuch. You shouldnt do things just because you feel good, or stop doing things just because you feel bad. Whether you feel good or bad, there is something you should do. If you dont have this kind of feeling when doing something, you have not yet started on our way in the true sense. I dont know why I am at Tassajara: it is not for you or for myself or even for Buddha or Buddhism. I am just here. But when I think I have to leave Tassajara in two or three weeks, I dont feel so good. I dont know why. I dont think it is just because you are my students. I dont have any particular person whom I love so much. I dont know why I have to be here. It is not because I am attached to Tassajara. Im not expecting anything in the future in terms of a big monastery or Buddhism. But I dont want to live up in the air. I want to be right here. I want to stand on my feet. The only way to stand on my feet when I am at Tassajara is to sit. That is the reason I am here. To stand on my feet and to sit on my black cushion are the most important things for me. I dont trust anything but my feet and my black cushion. They are my friends, always. My feet are always my friends. When I am in bed, my bed is my friend theres no Buddha, no Buddhism, no zazen. If you ask me What is zazen my answer will be to sit on my black cushion, or to walk with my feet. To stay at this moment in this place is my zazen. There is no other zazen. When I am really standing on my feet I am not lost. For me that is nirvana. There is no need to travel, to cross mountains or rivers. I am right here in the dharma world, so I have no difficulty crossing mountains and Do Not Pass Your Days and Nights in Vainrivers. That is how we dont waste time. Moment after moment we should live right here, without sacrificing this moment for the future. In China in Sekitos time, Zen Buddhism was very polemical. In the background of the teaching there was always some controversy. There were many schools of Zen, and they were often lost in dispute. And because they were involved in ideas of right and wrong teaching, or traditional and heretical teaching, they lost the main point of their practice. So Sekito said, Dont spend your time in vain. Dont sacrifice actual practice for idealistic practice, trying to attain some kind of perfection, or trying to find the traditional understanding as taught by the Sixth Ancestor. The disciples of the Sixth Ancestor compiled the Sutra of the Sixth Ancestor in dierent versions, and each said, This is the Sixth Ancestors way. Those who do not have this book are not the descendants of the Sixth Ancestor. This kind of understanding of Zen prevailed at that time. So Sekito said, I respectfully urge you who study the mystery, dont pass your days and nights in vain. Not to be caught by some idea, some selfish understanding of practice or teaching, is to follow our practice in the right way. This is sometimes called tilepolishing practice. Usually, people will polish a mirror. If someone starts to polish a tile you may laugh at him. But polishing a tile makes it shine. Someone may say, Oh, this is just a tile. It cannot be a mirror. That is the practice of those who give up easily, thinking, I cannot be a good Zen student, so I have to give up sit Twelfth Talkting zazen. They do not realize that a tile is valuable, sometimes more valuable than a mirror. No one can aord to make a roof with mirrors. Tiles are very good for making roofs, just as a mirror is important for looking at yourself. That is tilepolishing practice. As you know, there is a famous story about Nangaku, a disciple of the Sixth Ancestor, and Baso, his student. Baso was practicing zazen when Nangaku passed by and asked, What are you doingIm practicing zazen. Why are you doing that In order to become a buddha. Ah, its very nice of you to try to become a buddha, said Nangaku, and he picked up a tile and started to polish it.So Baso asked, with some curiosity, What are you doing I want to make this tile into a mirror. His disciple asked whether it was possible to make a tile into a mirror. Nangaku answered, You said you are practicing zazen to be a buddha, but a buddha is not always someone who attains enlightenment. Everyone is a buddha whether they have attained enlightenment or not. Baso said, I want to become a buddha through sitting practice. Nangaku said, You speak of practice in the sitting position. But to sit is not always Zen. Whatever you do, that will be zazen. Baso was lost. Then what would be the appropriate practice Do Not Pass Your Days and Nights in Vain Nangaku replied, If a cart does not go, what would be the appropriate means to make it goto hit the cart or to hit the horse Baso couldnt answer because he was still involved in practicing to attain something. So Nangaku continued his explanation. I cannot tell you all the details, but in short, what he said was, Trying to figure out which is rightto whip the horse or to whip the cart is wrong, because the cart and horse are not separate, they are one. Practice and enlightenment are one, like cart and horse. So if you do actual physical practice, that is also enlightenment. We call practice based on enlightenment real practice that has no end, and we call enlightenment that starts with practice and is one with practice beginningless enlightenment. If someone starts to practice, there is enlightenment, and where there is enlightenment, there is also practice. There is no enlightenment without practice. If you dont stay on this spot realizing your position, then you are not practicing our way. So you are wasting your time if you are sacrificing your present practice for some future attainment. That is not real practice. Sekito was also a direct disciple of the Sixth Ancestor, and he knew the Sixth Ancestors practice very well. So when Kataku Jinne and his disciples started to denounce the Northern school of Jinshu, Sekito felt bad about their being attached to some idea without realizing what practice is. His understanding was carried on by Dogen Zenji in Japan five centuries later. Dogen extended this understanding, not just logically Twelfth Talkbut more widely and with more feeling and in a more poetic way, through his tenacious thinking mind. Some people say the Sandokai is not such a good poem because it is so philosophical. It may be so if you dont understand the background of Sekitos teaching, and if your mind does not penetrate through his words. We say to read the back of the papernot just the printed characters, but the other side of the page. It is important for us to understand Sekitos Sandokai in this way.d i s c u s s i o nStudent: In light of what you said earlier, I dont understand the vows. If there are no sentient beings why do we vow to save them It sounds like a big joke.Suzuki Roshi: That is because your practice is always confined within the realm of Why do we practice zazen What does it mean Actually, your practice is very good. Why is your practice so good I dont understand. Laughs.Student: It doesnt feel so good to me.Suzuki Roshi: Anyway, you are doing well. My lecture may be some enticement. Laughs. It may be better for you not to listen to my talks. Just practice zazen.Student: I dont mind zazen so much, but I dont like to make promises I dont understand.Suzuki Roshi: If sentient beings are numberless, or desires are inexhaustible, you cannot say, I vow to save them. OurDo Not Pass Your Days and Nights in Vainpromise is very silly. It doesnt make any sense. I agree with you. But still we do it. Why Because we dont feel so good if we dont work for others. We take the four vows, but what we mean is more than that. For the sake of convenience, we say just the four. But I really, truly feel lucky that we have inexhaustible desires and numberless sentient beings to save, and also that it is almost impossible to save each of them in terms of I save you. You cannot save in that way. Whether it is possible or not, whether it is the Buddhist or bodhisattva or Hinayana or Mahayana way, is not the question. Anyhow, do it! That is our vow.Student: When I promise to do something, it has to have some meaning. If it doesnt have some meaning, I cant say it.Suzuki Roshi: That is your arrogance.Student: I dont know, maybe, butSuzuki Roshi: You are crying. Even though you are crying, that crying doesnt make any sense. Your effort is still based on some selfish practice. You dont give yourself up. You have to suffer and fight more with yourself. There is no one to fight with, and nothing to fight with. Fight with your selfish practice until you give up. That is the most important point for real students. They shouldnt fool themselves.They dont want to be fooled by our teaching, or by Zen, or by anything. That is right. They shouldnt be fooled by anything.Student: Well, what will I do at the end of talks, when we chant the four vows Everyone will chant the four vows, and I wont believe them.Twelfth TalkSuzuki Roshi: You dont have to believe in them literally. Because various teachers and numerous people recite them, you should do it. If they are cheating themselves, you, too, should be cheated you should be fooled along with all sentient beings. That you cannot do it means that you want to be a special person. That is good. That much spirit we should have but that is not our way. My answer is very cold. I cannot be sympathetic with your practice. Maybe some great teacher will give you some candy. Go and get it.Student: Its not like that, Roshi. Maybe part of it is, but I still dont understand. I dont feel right. Even if the whole world is fooled, if there is something I dont believe in, or I dont understandSuzuki Roshi: You dont understand. You see various colors, but how many colors do you see with your eyes How much sound can you hear How much can you understand with your small mind You should know the limit of your thinking mind. Your thinking mind only works dualistically. You have no words to explain this kind of reality. It is almost impossible to understand our teaching through words. But because you stick to my words, or to scriptures, you think the scriptures should be perfect, should be more convincing. You think in that way, but I must confess that what I say is not always right, not always true. I am suggesting something more than that. Not only Buddha, but Confucius also said, If someone wants to fool you, you should be fooled by them. That is very important.Do Not Pass Your Days and Nights in VainStudent: Even though practice is greater than words, still, in the small world of words I dont feel strong enough yet to be inconsistent. If I say to you, I dont see that lamp, Roshi, then something funny happens inside of me, and sometimes that same funny feeling happens inside of me when I say the vows. I think, Okay, I vow to save all sentient beings, but then something is going on inside that doesntSuzuki Roshi: Yes, I understand that. You know, we priests always put our palms together and bow when we meet. How many times have you put your hands together at Tassajara When I was young I didnt like it at all. I felt as if I was fooling myself, and I didnt feel so good. But as I had to do it, I did it, thats all. But now I understand, because I understand how foolish I am. I dont have as much spirit as I had before. Truth is truth, and I cant agree with you now. Maybe if I were your age I could agree with you quite easily and we would be great friends, but now I am not your friend.Student: Roshi, do you think that we have any choice For instance, am I here at Tassajara by my choice, or am I simply here at TassajaraSuzuki Roshi: Your buddha nature brought you here to Tassajara. I dont think it was your choice completely. Maybe twenty or thirty percent is your choice. But most of the reaTwelfth Talkson for your being here is beyond that. That we hear Buddhas teaching is because of our previous study. Wisdom seeks wisdom, and we are listening to the teaching that we have listened to under many teachers in past lives. Dogen says this. Even though you feel as if your whole body is saying, I am feeling this way one hundred percent, that voice that now seems to cover all of your being actually is only a little, tiny part of you. Maybe I shouldnt explain so much in the traditional way.Student: Well, then, if I were to become a buddha, would I have anything to do with itSuzuki Roshi: First of all, try to forget yourself and rely on your true voice, your voiceless voice, your nonverbal voice. Listen to the tongueless teaching, we say, dont listen to my words. Think about this.Student: Whose voice is it that we listen toSuzuki Roshi: Your voice and Buddhas voice. That is what the Sandokai is talking about. You sometimes think it is your voice, but it is Buddhas voice. Your thinking comes from a onesided feeling. You think you are here. You think you are Joe or Mary, but actually it is not so, not at all. I think I am Suzuki, but if someone calls me Suzuki, I feel very funny. Oh, is this Suzuki The first reaction is No, I am not Suzuki.Do Not Pass Your Days and Nights in VainStudent: Roshi, I may put my palms together in gassho and someone may look at me and say, Oh, that is a good gassho, but there may be a cold heart behind it.Suzuki Roshi: Cold heart or warm heart is not the question.Student: Is it still a good gasshoSuzuki Roshi: Perfect!t a l k g i v e n t o a v i s i t i n g c l a s sWe Are Just a Tiny Speck of Big BeingAn additional talk on the general spirit of the Sandokai, given to Tassajara students and a group of visiting philosophy students.The purpose of the study of Buddhism is to have a perfect understanding of things, to understand ourselves and what we are doing in our everyday life. It is also necessary to understand why we suffer and why we have so much conflict in our society, in our families, and within ourselvesin other words, to understand what is going on in the objective and subjective realms. If we see thingsasitis, and if we are aware of what we are doing and have a good understanding, we will know what we should do. This is the intellectual study of Buddhism, which includes both dualistic and nondualistic study. It is also necessary to have some real experience of the Buddhist way. Study and practice are dierent from each other even though you have a good understanding, if you do not follow that understanding, it will not help you. We are now studying the Sandokai, a poema kind of scripturewritten by a great Chinese Zen master. In one of my lectures, I explained what we mean by darkness and light. Darkness means something we cannot see or think about, Talk Given to a Visiting Classsomething beyond our intellectual understanding. We do not know what is going on in utter darkness. If you are in a dark place, you may be afraid. This room is pretty dark right now, but still you can see things. If there were no light, you could not see anything. But it would not mean there is nothing here. There are many things, but you would not be able to see them, thats all. So darkness means something that is beyond our understanding. And brightness means something you can understand in terms of good or bad, square or round, red or white. So brightness means the various things, and darkness means one whole being in which the many things exist. Even though there are many things, including the moon and stars, everything is so vast that we are just a tiny speck of big being. Darkness means something that includes everything. You cannot get out of it. Wherever you may go, that place is included in darkness. Utter darkness is a big, big being where everything can be acknowledged because by comparison everything is so small. That does not mean that there is nothing various things exist in one great whole being. However, whatever study we may be doing, it is always going on in the realm of brightness. We discriminate between things, saying, This is good, this is bad this is agreeable or disagreeable, right or wrong, big or small, round or square. Whatever you deal with appears in brightness in the dualistic world. But it is necessary for us to know the darkness, where there is nothing to see, nothing to think about. This will be experienced only in zazen practice. While thinking or listening to lectures or talking about the teaching, we cannot study what darkness We Are Just a Tiny Speck of Big Beingactually is. I cannot talk about darkness, but I can talk about something that we can understand, that will encourage you to practice zazen, and that will lead you to the experience of darkness. Darkness sometimes is called nothingness or emptiness, in contrast with somethingness. Sometimes we say no mind. You dont think when you are in utter darkness. But I feel I have gone too far laughs, so I have to come back to something, to some bright room. It is too dark to see your faces one by one, and what kind of problems you have. I think I must come back to our everyday problems. I was talking to a student about my relationship with my wife. I often complain, but I dont think I can live without her. That is, to tell the truth, what I really feel. Here at Tassajara I learned a very interesting expression: henpecked husband. There is no chance for this husband to raise his head he is always pecked by the hen. Still, he needs the hen. He feels as if it is impossible to live with her maybe it would be better to get divorced. Then sometimes he thinks, Oh, but I cannot live without her. So I cannot live with her, and I cannot live without her. What should I do This is a problem we have in the world of brightness. When the lamp is bright I can see myself and my wife when there is no lamp there is no problem. But we dont think about the darkness. We always suffer from the life that we can see with our eyes and hear with our ears. That is what we are doing. In the world of brightness it is dicult to live without others. To live with them is also dicult. That is the problem we have. What shall we do But if you have even the slightest Talk Given to a Visiting Classunderstanding of darkness, which is the other side of brightness, then you will find out how to live in the brightness of the world. In brightness you will see something good and something bad, or something right and something wrong. In this world of dierentiation, things exist in various forms and colors, and at the same time we can find the equality of everything. The only chance for us to be equal is to be aware of and respect the world of form and color. Only when you respect yourself as a learned person or as an ignorant person will you find true equality. We think equality means to share something equally with everyone. But that is not possible. That is a kind of dream. For instance, if we share our food equally with others, some may like it and some may not it is impossible to share things equally. For everyone to have the same responsibility, or duty, or commitment is not possible. Only when we realize and respect our own capacity, our own physical strength, our own nature as man or woman, and our own character or nature, will each one of us be equal. This equality is a little bit dierent from the usual understanding of equality. Here is a cup in which I have some water. Water and cup are not equal water is water, and cup is cup. If the water wants to be a cup, that is not possible, and this is true also for the cup. The cup should be a cup, and water should be water. When water is in the cup, water serves its purpose and the cup serves its purpose. A cup without water and water without a cup mean nothing to us. When water is We Are Just a Tiny Speck of Big Beingwater, and cup is cup, and cup and water have some relationship with each other, they become interdependent so water will have its own value, and the cup will have its own value. In this sense we say that the cup and water are equal. If you think freedom is just to ignore rules and act as you want, that is a kind of dream, a delusion. Actually freedom does not exist in that way, and we shouldnt be involved in a vain effort to try to catch a cloud. The way to get out of the difficulty is to have a good understanding of ourselves. We need to know what we are doing, to know what is possible and what is not. And we should be very realistic, or whatever we do will not work. If you enjoy your daydreams that is another matter. Sometimes it is good to think about something impossible, to dream about something wonderful. The point then is just to enjoy it like a movie. You feel like a movie star. That is good, but it cannot be our final goal in life. We should know what is delusion and what is reality. When we are sincerely involved in good practice, we should not dream of something impossible. We should work for something that is possible to realize. So the other side of dierentiation is equality. Because things are dierent there is equality. When you understand the equality of man and woman in its true sense, you have no more problems. I cannot live without her, you may say. When you feel that way you dont know who she is and who you are. When you realize that she is important because she is who she is, then you understand her nature. If a husband is more idealistic than realistic, thinking about doing something that Talk Given to a Visiting Classseems almost impossible and ignoring what may happen to him, his wife may say, Oh, dont do that it is too soon. Wait. Wait. Laughs. If she says that, he may think, Oh, I must do it right away. And he will complain, I cannot live with her. Laughs. But that is her nature. A hasty, careless man can benefit from a careful, more conservative woman. Sometimes she may be very angry with her husband, but that is also her nature. So when he says, I cannot live with her, something is missing in his understanding. The other day I said the Chinese character for human is two lines supporting each other . Man and woman may be like this, or teacher and disciple. If there is no teacher there is no disciple if there is no disciple there is no teacher. So when teacher and disciple exist like the two lines in this character, supporting each other, there is a monastery. Everything exists in that way. I cannot exist without her, or without him is right. Many difficulties are created when you lack this understanding of the other side of each event or thing. The other side of good will be bad the other side of bad will be good that is reality. So the other side of darkness is brightness. You may say this room is dark, but it is brighter than the basement where there is no light. And even the basement is brighter than the hole of a mole. So you cannot say bright or dark, actually. Bright or dark is only in your mind there is no bright or dark in reality. Yet sometimes we need some standards or rules or means of communication, so we say something is good or bad, agreeable or disagreeable. These are just words. We shouldnt We Are Just a Tiny Speck of Big Beingbe caught by words. When your girlfriend says, I dont like you! you may take her words literally. Maybe she means the opposite. Because she likes you so much, sometimes she feels I hate you, but it is not actually so. If you stick to words without observing things from both sides, you will not know what to do. Our eyes open only toward the outside, and we cannot see inside ourselves. Because of this we tend to be concerned about anothers practice or life and to be very critical. Even though we may think about what kind of practice we should have, we cannot find our own way because our eyes are directed toward the outside. When you say, Which way should I take the I is here, the way is over there, and the nature of I is not realized. If you dont know this , you are completely ignorant about yourself. So you criticize yourself as you criticize others. That is terrible! You cannot exist in this world because of your sharp criticism. It is very easy to criticize others. It may be a little bit more dicult to criticize yourself because you may not feel so good, but you do it anyway, and you suffer. That is what we do every day. You suffer because something is missing in your understanding of what you are doing. According to Buddhist understanding, things that look like they exist outside are actually existing inside ourselves. When you think, He is not good, you are actually criticizing someone within yourself. It is a picture of yourself. This is the understanding of the big mind that includes everything. Things happen only within yourself they are activities of your life Talk Given to a Visiting Classwithin yourself, like your stomach digesting things. In your mind you may think, Here is my heart, and here is my tummy, and you may not be aware of the relationship between them. You may think that by surgery you can cut out your tummy without aecting your heart. But it is not actually so. Your heart and your tummy are closely related to each other, and if you make your tummy strong, your heart may be improved. So it is not always necessary to have a big operation on your heart. When you understand that things are closely related, there is no need to say tummy or heart anymore. When you are in good health, you dont necessarily know what is going on in your physical body when your life is sound and good, you dont talk about him or her or yourself. The way to obtain this kind of harmonious life within yourself is by practice. Talking about things is like arranging food on your plate. Every morning our students arrange food beautifully on each dish. But fortunately or unfortunately, when I chew it, it is all mixed up in my mouth and I just have the taste of foodno color, no beauty, no sesame salt or brown rice. It is even more mixed up when it reaches my tummy. I dont even know what it is. When things are in full activity, there is no idea of good or bad, this or that. It is good to see food arranged in dierent dishes. It is good to think about food, your life, or the nature of man and woman. But even though you think about these things, it doesnt mean much unless you really have a taste of them in your life. Unless you chew it up, mix it all together, and swallow it, your life doesnt make much sense. We Are Just a Tiny Speck of Big Being We study Buddhism like this, just as we arrange our food in dierent dishes and appreciate its color and form. But eventually we must eat it, and then there is no teaching whatsoever. When you actually eat it, there is no teacher or disciple there is no Buddha or Christ. How to eat is our practice. We are fortunate that even though we chew things up and mix them together, we also know how to analyze them in various ways, and we know what we have been doing. To analyze your psychology or your practice is important, but that is the shadow of your practice, not the practice itself. So we will practice on and on in this way, arranging carefully and mixing together and chewing and analyzing to see what is going on. What am I doing In this way, analyzing in a bright light and mixing in a dark room, over and over, our practice goes on and on endlessly. At the end of the Sandokai Sekito says that if you go on in this way, step by step, it is not a matter of a thousandmile trip or a onemile trip. There is no enlightenment and no ignorance, because we are going on and on and on, and we are always on the path of the Buddha. But if you stop working and stick to the idea of good or bad, then you will have difficulty, like crossing a big river or a high mountain. You create the river and the mountain for yourself. They dont exist. When you analyze, when you criticize yourself, you have some special concept of yourself in terms of good or bad and you think that is you. It is not actually so, but thats how you create difficulty for yourself. That is what we are always doing. Talk Given to a Visiting Classd i s c u s s i o nStudent: You said that zazen is within darkness, and listening to the lecture is within brightness. If someone listens to the lecture with a good understanding, then thats zazen, isnt itSuzuki Roshi: The Sandokai says that even though you recognize the truth, that is not enlightenment. But the lectures will encourage you, and you will know why you practice zazen. You are arranging things according to my Buddhist recipe, and you are cooking something here at Tassajara. The dishes are before you, so you should eat what you cooked. How to eat it is to practice zazen. This food is prepared for people who practice zazen, so to eat it will help your practice.Student: You said zazen is darkness and the lecture is brightness, and you have also talked about ri being dark and ji being bright, but what I want to know is whether you can really separate them.Suzuki Roshi: That is a good point. We are purposely separating something that cannot be separated. It is like two sides of a coin: this side is brightness and the other side is darkness. I am talking about this bright side, and by your practice you will see the other side. Then you will see the whole picture of the Sandokai that is reality. Thinking that by your practice you will understand something completely dierent from this bright side is a big mistake.Student: I was wondering why you spoke about one side or the other. Is it impossible to speak about both sides togetherWe Are Just a Tiny Speck of Big BeingSuzuki Roshi: Both sides together is not possible, because whatever you talk about is the bright side. It is not possible to talk about the other side. But because I have some experience or understanding of the other side, I can talk about this bright side. If I had no experience of the other side, what I am talking about wouldnt mean anything. No matter how beautifully I may describe it, this bright side would be poison for you then. This bright side is something quite dierent from the other side, and it is not possible to mix them or put them together. Again, something that does not agree with the other side is poisonous. A teaching may look very beautiful, but if it isnt in accord with the other side, if the other side is ignored, that teaching is like opium.Student: Before lectures, we chant, An unsurpassed, penetrating, and perfect dharma, and I am just wondering how the lecture enters into darkness. How does a lecture teach us How is it something besides brightness How is the lecture zazen, or what is teishoSuzuki Roshi: Teisho is to give encouragement. It is not just to talk about something, but to give some suggestions and to help people have a good understanding of our practice. The words must come from the actual experience of I hesitate to say the actual experience of enlightenment. These are big words. The actual experience of reality is teisho. The words should not be dead they should not be something that we study or read in a book. That is the difference between teisho and lecture. Strictly speaking, lectures give some knowledge of someTalk Given to a Visiting Classthing teisho helps peoples actual practice and enlightenment. So pushing people toward real practice is teisho. Here is something you must have as a Buddhist. Look! That is teisho. We must have something real to talk about. If you read this book holding up a book, even memorize it, that is not teisho. Teisho is something that comes from inside, from the bottom of the heart. Because I must use words, I must follow logic and use special, technical philosophical terms. But sometimes, ignoring those terms, we can speak directly about reality. Sometimes it may not be with words. Knocks on the table. This is teisho. To talk about something that is not possible to talk about is teisho. Excuse me. I cannot explain it so well.Student: You say that your talk on the Sandokai is supposed to give us understanding. But you also say that we cant understand the bright side unless we understand the dark side unless we have good zazen. Is your talk just skillful meansSuzuki Roshi: You will stick to my words. So after giving a talk, I take it from you. It is just something intellectual. You should forget what I said, but you should sense the real meaning of my words.Student: Is talking to students Buddhas skillful meansSuzuki Roshi: It should be that way whether we are Buddhists or not. But Buddhists know that if we stick to words we will be enslaved by words, and we will understand just a little part of what is said. When you are interested in something that We Are Just a Tiny Speck of Big Beinghave pointed out with this finger, it may be better for me to cut o this finger so you will not be attached to it anymore. We explain how to cook something in a book, but actually what we do is cut vegetables, put salt on them, and boil them. As long as you depend on what is written in the cookbook, it may take time before you can cook! When you can forget all about your cookbook you will be a good cook. It is better to study by seeing someone who is actually doing it. That is the best way. To give something directly is teisho. Usually your attitude in listening to teisho is to think about whether it is good or bad. You wonder, What is he speaking about If it is good, I will accept it. If it is not good, I will not accept it. That is extra you dont need to be so careful. If you just listen, you dont even need to try to understand it. If you dont understand, it is okay if you do understand, it is better, thats all. There should be no special intention in listening. Just to listen is how you should receive teisho. It is dierent from studying something. As your mind works logically, I have to be logical. If you are not logical, I can say whatever I like. I can even sing a song. Oneness of One and ManyThe mind of the great sage of Indiawas handed down closely from west to east. People may discriminate the dull from the keen,but in the true way there is no Ancestor of North or South.The true source is pure and stainless.The branch streams flow in the dark.Clutching at things is delusion.To recognize the truth is not always enlightenment either. The five sense gates and the five sense objectsare interdependent and absolutely independent interrelated endlessly,yet each stays in its own position.Things have various natures, various forms.There is good and bad taste, sound, and feeling.In darkness, superior and inferior cannot be distinguished in brightness, the duality of pure and impure is apparent. The four elements resume their nature as a child has its mother.Fire is hot, wind blows,water wets, and earth is solid.For eyes there is color and form, for ears there is sound, for the nose there is smell, and for the tongue there is taste Each being comes out from the rootas branches and leaves come out from the trunk.But both root and end should return to their original nature.The words we use are differentgood and bad, respectful and meanbut through these words we should understand the absolute being or source of the teaching.Within brightness actually there is utter darkness but you should not meet someone just with darkness. Within darkness there is brightnessbut you should not see others only with the eyes of brightness. Darkness and brightness stand with each otherlike one foot forward and the other behind in walking.Everythingall beingshave their own virtue.You should know how to apply this truth.Things and emptiness are like a container and its cover fitting together,like two arrows meeting headon.When you listen to the words, you should understand the source of the teaching.Dont establish your own rules.If you dont practice in your everyday life as you walk, how can you know the way The goal is neither far nor near.If you stick to the idea of good or bad, you will be separated from the way by high mountains or big rivers.Seekers of the truth,dont spend your time in vain.Calmness of MindShikantaza, our zazen, is Just to be ourselves. When we do not expect anything we can be ourselves. That is our way, to live fully in each moment of time. This practice continues forever. We say, each moment, but in your actual practice a moment is too long because in that moment your mind is already involved in following the breath. So we say, Even in a snap of your fingers there are millions of instants of time. This way we can emphasize the feeling of existing in each instant of time. Then your mind is very quiet. So for a period of time each day, try to sit in shikantaza, without moving, without expecting anything, as if you were in your last moment. Moment after moment you feel your last instant. In each inhalation and each exhalation there are countless instants of time. Your intention is to live in each instant. First practice smoothly exhaling, then inhaling. Calmnes. of mind is beyond the end of your exhalation. If you exhale smoothly, without even trying to exhale, you are entering into the complete perfect calmness of your mind. You do not exist anymore. When you exhale this way, then naturally your inhalation Owill start from there. All that fresh blood bringing everything from oUlside will pervade your body. You are completely refreshed. Then you start to exhale, to extend that fresh feeling into emptiness. So, moment after moment, without trying to do anything, you continue shikantaza. Complete shikantaza may be difficult because of the pain in your legs when you are sitting crosslegged. But even though you have pain in your legs, you can do it. Even though your practice is not good enough, you can do it. Your breathing will gradually vanish. You will gradually vanish, fading into emptines.. Inhaling without effort you naturally come back to yourself with some color or form. Exhaling, you gradually fade into emptines.empty, white paper. That is shikalltaz... The important point is your exhalation. Instead of trying to feel yourself as you inhale, fade into emptines. as you exhale. When you practice this in your last moment, you will have nothing to be afraid of. You are actually aiming at emptiness. You become one with everything after you completely exhale with this feeling. If you are still alive, naturally you will inhale again. Oh, 'm still alive! Fortunately or unfortunately! Then you start to exhale and fade into emptiness. Maybe you don't know what kind of feeling it is. But some of you know it. By some chance you must have felt this kind of feeling. When you do this practice, you cannot easily become angry. When you are more interested in inhaling than in exhaling, you easily become quite angry. You are always trying to be alive. The other day my friend had a heart attack, and all he could do was exhale. He couldn't inhale. That was a terrible feeling, he said. At that moment if he could have practiced exhaling as we do, aiming for emptiness, then I think he would not have felt so bad. The great joy for us is exhaling rather than inhaling. When my friend kept trying to inhale, he thought he couldn't inhale any .Nr,Imore.If he could have exhaled smoothly and completely, then Ithink another inhalation would have come more easily. To take care of the exhalation is very important. To die is more important than trying to be alive. When we always try to be alive, we have trouble. Rather than trying to be alive or active, if we can be calm and die or fade away into emptin', then naturally we will be all right. Buddha will take care of us. Because we have lost our mother's bosom, we do not feel like her child anymore. Yet fading away into emptiness can feel like being at our mother's bosom, and we will feel as though she will take care of us. Moment after moment, do not lose this practice of shikantaza.Various kinds of religious practice are included in this point.When people say ' Alllidil ,Isl, I Iidll , the want to be Amida Buddha's children. That is why they praticerepeating Amida Buddha's name. The same is true with ourr zazen practice. If we know how to practice shikantaza, and if they know how to repeat Amida Buddha's name, it cannot be different. So we have enjoyment, we are free. We feel free to ePress ourselves because we are ready to fade into emptiness. When We are trying to be active and special and to accomplish something, we cannot expres. ourselves. Small self will be expressed, but big self will not appear from the emptiness. From the emptiness onl great self appears. That is shikantaza, okay It is not so difficult if you really try.Thank you very much.Express Yourself FullyWhen you live completely in each moment, without expecting anything, you have no idea of time. When you are involved in an idea of timetoday, tomorrow, or next yearselfish practice begins. Various desires stan to behave mischievously. You may think you should get ordained, or you worry about what your next step will be. Trying to become someone else, you lose your practice and lose your virtue. When you are faithful to your position or your work, your true being is there. This is a very important point. Without any idea of time, your practice goes on and on. Moment after moment you become you yourself. This practice is not so easy. You may not be able to continue it for even one period of meditation. You will need to make a big effort. Then you can practice extending this feeling moment after moment. EvenlUaUy it will extend to your everyday life. The way to extend your practice is to expose yourself as you are, without trying to be someone else. When you are very hon Yest with yourself and brave enough, you can express yourself fully. Whatever people may think, it is all right. Just be yourself, at least for your teacher. That is actual practice, your actual life. Unless you trust your teacher, this is rather difficult, but if you find out that your teacher's spirit is the same as your spirit, then you will be brave enough to continue practicing in this way. Sometimes you have to argue with your teacher. That is okay, but you should try to understand him and be ready to give up your argument when you are wrong, when you find yourself foolishly sticking to one point of view, or when you are making some excuse. That is how to be honest with yourself. Then you can give up: Okay, I surrender. 'm sorry. You and your teacher are aiming to have perfect communication. For a teacher the important point is always to be ready to surrender to his disciple. When a teacher realizes he is wrong, he can say, Oh, you are right, I was wrong. If your teacher has that kind of spirit, you will be encouraged to admit your mistake as well, even when it is not so easy. If you continue this kind of practice, people may say, You are crazy. Something is wrong with you. But it doesn't maner. We are not the same. Each one of us is different, and each one of us has our own problems. Fortunately you have the support of others who are practicing with you. This is not an umbrella to provide shade to protect you but a space where you can have real practice, a space where you can express yourself fully. You can open your eyes to appreciate the practice of others, and you will find that you are able to communicate without words. Our way is not to criticize others but to know and appreciate them. Sometimes you may feel you know someone too well, and you have difficulty appreciating them because of your small mind. If you continue practicing together, and your mind is big Oenough to expose yourself and accept others, naturally you will become good friends. To know your friend is to know something beyond yourself, beyond even your friend. You may say that when you are practicing zazen, no one can know your practice, but for me that is the best time to understand you. When you sit facing the wall and I see you from behind, it is especially easy to understand what kind of practice you have. Sometimes I walk around the meditation hall so that I can see you. This is very interesting. If you are dancing or talking or making a big noise, it is rather difficult to understand you. But when we are sitting together, you each sit in your own way. It is a big mistake to think that the best way to express yourself is to do whatever you want, acting however you please. This is not expressing yourself. When you have many pos.ible ways of expressing yourself, you are not sure what to do, so you will behave superficially. If you know what to do exactly, and you do it, you can express yourself fully. That is why we follow forms. You may think that you cannot express yourself within a particular form, but when we are all practicing together, strong people will expres. themselves in a strong way and kind people will express themselves kindly. When we pass the sutra cards along the row during service, you each do it in your own way. The differences among you are easy to see because the form is the same. And because we repeat the same thing over and over again, we can understand our friends' ways eventually. Even if your eyes are shut, you know, Oh, that was soandso. This is the advantage of having rules and rituals. Without this kind of practice your relationships with people will be very superficial. If someone wears a beautiful robe here he rubs his robe and laughs, you will think he must be a good priest. If someone gives you a beautiful thing, you will think she FfIis very kind, that she is a wonderful person. That kind of understanding is not so good. Usually our society works in a superficial, frivolous way. The controlling power is money or some big noise. Our eyes and ears are not open or subtle enough to see and hear things. Most people who visit Zen Center find it a strange place: They do not talk so much. They do not even laugh. What are they doing Those who are accustomed to big noises may not notice, but we can communicate without talking so much. We may not always be smiling, but we feci what others are feeling. Our mind is always open, and we are expressing ourselves fully. We can extend this practice to city life and be good friends with one another. This is not difficult when you decide to be honest with yourself and express yourself fully, without expecting anything. Just being yourself and being ready to understand others is how to extend your practice into everyday life. We don't know what will happen. If you fail to express yourself fully on each moment, you may regret it later. Because you expect some future lime, you miss your opportunity, and you are misunderstood by your friend. Do not wait to express yourself fully.Thank you very much.Freedom from EverythingMy practice of shikantaza or zazen changed about two years ago, after I almost drowned. I wanted to cross the creek at Tassajara. I cannot actually swim, but the students were enjoying the water so much, I thought I would join them. There were many beautiful girls over there so I tried to go over there, forgetting that I couldn't swim, and I almost drowned. But I knew I would not die. I knew I would not drown because there were many students, and someone would help me, so it was not so serious. But the feeling was pretty bad. I was swallowing water, so I stretched out my arms hoping that someone would catch me, but no one helped me. I decided to go to the bottom, to walk, but that was not possible either. I could not reach the bottom and I could not get above the surface. What I saw was the legs of beautiful girls. But I could not take hold of their legs, and I was rather scared. At that time I realized that we never have good practice until we become quite serious. Because I knew that I was not dying, I was not so serious, and because I was not so serious, I had a very difficult time. If I knew I was dying, I would not have struggled anymore. I would have stayed still. Because I thought I had another moment, I did not become serious. Since then my practice has improved. Now I have confidence in my practice, so I have been teUing you how I sit in shikantaza. It was a very interesting experience. I was among beautiful girls, but the beautiful girls could not save me. And, as you know, I am dying because of my sickness, not because of water. When I am dying, various demons as well as beautiful women will be happy to be with me, and I will be very happy to be with them. Everything is with us, and without being disturbed, we are happy to be with everything. Usually it is difficult to feci that vay because we are involved in gaining ideas, expecting some improvement in the future. When you are not thinking that you have another moment, then naturally you can accept things as they are, you can see things as they are. You will have perfect wisdom at that time. When you are able to sit, experiencing shikantaza, then the meaning of your everyday life will be completely different. You will have freedom from everything. That is the main point. Usually you have no freedom from the things you have or see, but when you experience shikantaza, you will have freedom from things. You will truly enjoy your life, because you are not attached to anything. You become really happy, and that happiness will continue, which is what we mean by nonattachment. Most of the happiness you have is the kind you later regret losing: Oh, at that time I was happy, but now I am not so happy. Out real happiness will always be with you and will encourage you in both your adversity and your happiness. When you are successful, you will enjoy the success, and when you fail, it will also be okay. You can enjoy the feeling of failure: Oh, this is pretty good not as bad as I thought! You will always have enough. You won't want too much, as you did before. If you come to a great difficulty, like a big mountain in Nepal that looks like it has no passageway, you will know there is a way to get through. Even a hundredday sesshin is not difficult. Even though you die, nothing happens. It is okay. So you are always happy, and you will not be discouraged. And the kind of life you choose will be different. Before you have right practice, you may want something big and beautiful: the numberone Zenpractice monastery in the United States, in the world even better than in Japan. But afterwards, the things you choose and the way of life you follow will be different. Sometimes I give pretty serious lectures. I put emphasis on difficult, hard practice: Don't expect the next moment. Don't move! I am sorry, but I have to say this because your practice looks so weak, and I want to make you stronger. Actually, it is okay that your practice is not so good, but if you are not strict enough with yourself, and if you lack confidence, then zazen cannot be zazen. It doesn't work. What makes your practice go deeper and deeper is the daybyday effort of sitting. In China and Japan there are many stories of teachers who attained enlightenment suddenly like this: Ump''' laughs and snaps his fingers You may think it was sudden, but actually it was the result of many years of practice and of failing many times. Dogen Zenji's famous words concerning this are, Hitting the mark is the result of ninetynine failures. The last arrow hit the mark, but only after ninetynine failures. So failure is actually okay. Each time you shoot, shoot with confidence. Then you are sure to hit the mark. Ninetynine failures are okay. I will continue to try to hit the mark. Each time you sit, do your best. You may think that zazen is cros..ing your lcgs for forry minutes, but the most importam poim is to put all your effort, physical and spiritual, into it. Concentrate on your breath. When your breathing is not appropriate, it is hard to do any physical work. Even when you sew, your breathing should follow your activiry. When you lift somcthing heavy, your breathing should be completely harmonized, or else you cannot lift it. It is not so easy to have good breathing. You will need good posture and a good mudra ritual hand posture I because your mudra is a symbol of your memal state. If your spine is not straight, your breathing will not be deep enough. Of course, it takes time to develop all of your mental and physical effort. Enlightenment does not come until your mind and body are in perfect accord. If you cannot accept your experience, you won't feel you have enlightenmem. In other words, when your mind and body are completely one, then enlightenment is there. Whatcver you hear, whatever you think, that is enlightenmem. So it is not the sound of a stonc hitting bamboo or thc color of plum blossoms that makes people enlightened. It is their practice. In your everyday lifc you always have opportunities for enlightenment. If you go to the rest room, there is a chance to attain enlightenment. When you cook, there is a chance to attain enlightenmem. When you clean the Roor, there is a chance to attain enlightcnmem. So whatever you do, just do it, without expecting anyone's help. Don't spoil your elTort by seeking for shelter. Protect yourself and grow upright to the sky that is all. That's all, but it is a little bit unusual, isn't it Maybe we are crazy. Some people may think that we are crazy, and we may think they are crazy. It's okay. We will find out pretry soon who is crazy.Thank you very much.Why do we practice Zen when we already have Buddha nature This was the great question that Dogen Zenji worked on before he went to China and met Tendo Nyojo Zenji. This is not an easy problem, but first of all what does it mean when we say everyone has Buddha nature The usual understanding is that Buddha nature is something innate within ourselves, and because of this nature, we do something. If there is a plant, there must be a seed that was there before the plant appeared. Because of their natures, some Rowers are red and some Rowers are yellow. Most of us understand in that way, but that is not Dogen's understanding. That kind of nature is an idea you have in your mind. Why would we practice when we already have Buddha nature We may think that Buddha nature will appear only after we practice and eliminate various selfish desires. According to Dogen Zenji though, that kind of understanding is based on your unclear observation of things. His understanding is that only when something appears is its Buddha nature reality. Sometimes we say Buddha nature. Sometimes we say enlightenment or bodhi, Buddha or attainment. We ca Buddha nature not only by these names, but sometimes we ca it evil desires. We may say evil desires, but for Buddha, that is Buddha nature. In the same way some people may think that laypeople and priests are fundamentaUy different, but actually there is no particular person who is a priest. Each one of you could be a priest, and I could be a layperson. Because I wear a robe I am a priest, and I behave like a priest. That's a. There is no innate nature that distinguishes priest from layperson. Whatever you ca it, that is another name of one reality. Even though you ca it a mountain or a river, that is just another name of the one reality. When we realize this, we are not fooled by words like 'nature,' 'result,' or 'Buddhahood.' We see things themselves with a clear mind. We understand Buddha nature in this way. Evil desires is another name for Buddha nature. When we practice zazen, where would evil desires come from In zazen there is no place for evil desires. Sti we may believe that evil desires should be eliminated. Why is that You want to eliminate your evil desires in order to reveal your Buddha nature, but where will you throw them away When we think that evil desires are something we can throw away, that is heretical. Evil desires is just a name we use, but there is no such thing that we can separate out and throwaway. You may feel as if I am fooling you, but it is not so. It is no laughing matter. When we come to this point, it is necessary to understand our practice of shikantaza. There is a famous koan about a man who climbs to the top of a loofoot pole. If he stavs at the ton pole, he may be the enlightened one. How we understand this koan is how we understand our practice. The reason we believe that evil desires should be thrown out is because we stay at the top of the pole. Then we have a problem. Actually there is no top of the pole. The pole continues forever, so you cannot stop there. But when you have some experience of enlightenment, you may think that you can rest there, observing variolls sights from the top of the pole. Things are continuously growing or changing into something else. Nothing exists in its own form or color. When you think that Here is the top, then you will have the problem of whether or not to jump of. But you cannot jump off from here. That is already a misunderstanding. It is not possible. And even though you try to stop at the top of the pole, you cannot stay there because it is growing continuously. That is the problem, so forget all about stopping at the top of the pole. To forget about the top of the pole is to be where you are right now. Not to be this way or that way, not to be in the past or the future, but to be right here. Do you understand This is shikantaza. Forget this moment and grow into the next. That is the only way. For instance, when breakfast is ready, my wife hits some wooden clappers. If I don't answer, she may continue to hit them until I feel rather angry. This problem is quite simpleit is becallse I don't answer. If I say Hail Yes!, there is no problem. Because I don't say Yes! she continues to ca me because she doesn't know whether or not I heard her. Sometimes she may think, He knows, but he doesn't answer. When I don't answer, I am on the top of the pole. I don't jump off. I believe I have something important to do at the top of the pole: You shouldn't call me. You should wait. Or I may think, This is very important! I am here, on the top of the pole! Don't you know that Then she will keep hitting the clappers. That is how we create problems. So the secret is just to say Yes! and jump off from here. Then there is no problem. It means to be yourself in the present moment, always yourself, without sticking to an old self. You forget a about yourself and are refreshed. You are a new self, and before that self becomes an old self, you say Yes! and you walk to the kitchen for breakfast. So the point on each moment is to forget the point and extend your practice. As Dagen Zenji says, To study Buddhism is to study yourself. To study yourself is to forget yourself on each moment. Then everything will come and help you. Everything will assure your enlightenment. When I say Yes! my wife will assure my enlightenment. Oh, you are a good boy! But if I stick to this, I am a good boy, I will create another problem. So on each moment just concentrate and really be yourself. At this moment, where is Buddha nature Buddha nature is when you say Yes! That Yes! is Buddha nature itself. The Buddha nature which you think you already have within yourself is not Buddha nature. When you become you yourself, or when you forget all about yourself and say Yes! that is Buddha nature. This Buddha nature is not something that will appear in the future, but something that is already here. If you have only an idea about Buddha nature, it doesn't mean anything. It is a painted rice cake, not an actual one. If you want to see an actual rice cake, you should see it when it is here. So the purpose of our practice is just to be yourself. When you become just yourself, you have real enlightenment. If you try to hold onto what you attained previously, that is not actual enlightenment. Sometimes you will laugh at yourself when you fa into wrong practice. Oh, what am I doing When you understand how practice goes back and forth, you will enjoy your practice. Real compassion or love, real encouragement or true courage will arise from here, and you will be a very kind person. We say, One practice covers everything, which means that practice includes many virtues like the waves of the sea. When you practice in this way, you become like a stone, a tree, or an ocean. You cover everything. Continuous practice is necessary, so do not rest. How to continue is to have generous mind, big mind, and soft mind to be flexible, not sticking to anything. Practicing in this way there is no need to be afraid of anything, or to ignore anything. That is strictness of the Way. When we are not afraid of anything, we are imperturbable. To be completely concentrated on what you do, that is simplicity. And the beauty of practice is that it can be extended endlessly. You cannot say that our way is quite easy or that it is very difficuh. It is not difficuh at all. Everyone can do it, but to continue it is rather difficult. Don't you think soThank you very much.You become very serious when you have a big problem, withour realizing that you are always creating problems. With a smaller problcm, you think, Oh, this is no trouble, so can manage it quite easily. You may think this without even knowing how you will cope with the problem you have. The other day Tatsugami Roshi said, A tiger catches a mouse with his whole strength. A tiger does not ignore or slight any small animal. The way he catches a mouse and the way he catches and devours a cow are the same. But usually, although you have many problems, you think they are minor, so you don't think it is necessary to exert yourself. That is the way many countries treat their international problems: This is a minor problem. As long as we do not violate international treaties, it will be okay. As long as we do not use atomic weapons, we can fight. But that kind of small fight eventually will result in a big fight. So even though the problems you have in your everyday life are small, unless you know how to solve them you will have big difficultics. This is the law of karma. Karma starts from small things, bur with neglect your bad karma will accelerate. Recently I read some of Buddha's teaching about the Way: Brethren, restrain your many desires while receiving food and drink, accept it as medicine. Do not accept or reject it based on what you like or dislike. Just support your bodies and avoid starvation and thirst. As a bee in gathering honey tastes the Rower, bill does not harm its color or scelll, so brethren, you may accept just enough of people's offerings to avoid distres.. Don't have many demands and thereby break their good hearts. Wise men, for example, having judged the capacity of their animals' strength, do not wear them o by overloading them. To restrain your many desires is not really a maner of big or small, many or few. The idea is to go beyond desires. To have few desires means not to divide our concelllration among too many things. To do things with oneness of mind, with truehearted spirit that is to have few desires. While receiving food and drink, accept it as medicine. This means to be concelllratcd, accepting it with your whole body and mind, without any dualistic idea of you and food. So we receivc or accept food rather than saying that we take food. Taking is more dualistic. Accepting is a more complete activity. You may think that to takc is a more complete action than to accept. But according to Buddha's teaching, to grasp or take food does not include complete acccptance. Because it is dualistic, you will create karma. You may wish to grasp it because some other person walli to take it, so you must be very quick! Bill when you receive it, already you have it, and if you accept it with great appreciation Thank you very muchthat is what Buddha mea I as the truc activity of restraining your desires. not accept or reject it based on what you like or dislike. Again, to accept or reject in this way is dualistic. This kind of teaching does not mcan to have control over your desires. If you want to cOlllrol your desires, you will struggle with how much to limit your desires or your food, and in that way you will make more problems, one after another. You may even find some good excuse to have more food. Then you will lose your way. Just support your bodies and avoid starvation and thirst. If you know how to practice zazen, then you will know how much food to take, and there is no danger of eating too much or too little. As a bee in gathering honey tastes the flower but does not harm its color or scent. This is a very famous parable. When we take honey because the flower is beautiful or the scent is nice, we miss the true taste of the flower. When you are laking care of yourself and Ihe flower, you can have a direct feeling of the flower and raSle its honey. Often we are not so careful. We may ruin a beauliful flower or we may stick to a parlicular flower. If we stick much, eventually the flower will die. The purpose of the flower having honey is to help the plant by inviting bees. So it is necessary to know whether we are like a bee or like something else. When we are aware of the difficulties that we sometimes create, we can extend our practice more carefully throughout our everyday life. Our minds should be more careful, more attentive, and more reflective. You may think our way has too many rules about how to treat things. But before you know what you are doing, you cannot say there are many rules. So realise whether you are creating problems in your everyday life or creating bad karma for yourself and for others. And you should also know why you suffer right now. There is a reason why you suffer, and it is not possible to escape from suffering unless you change your karma. When you follow karma and drive karma in a good direction, you can avoid Ihe deslructive nature of karma. You can do that by being attentive to the nature of karma and the nature of your desires and activities. As Buddha pointed out, to know the cause of suffering is to know how to avoid suffering. If you study why you sutffer, you will understand cause and effect, and how bad actions result in bad effects. Because you understand, you can avoid the destructive power of karma. As long as we have an idea of self, karma has an object to work on, so the best way is to make karma work on the voidness of space. If we have no idea of self, karma doesn't know what to do Ohhh, where is my partner, where is my friend Some people try hard to banish karma, but I don't think that is possible. The best way is to know the strict rules of karma and to work on our karma immediately. If you know something is wrong with your car, stop your car immediately and work on it. But usually we don't. Oh, this is a minor problem for my car. It is still running. Let's go. That is not our way. Even though we can keep driving, we should take care of our car very carefully. If you push your car to the limit, the problems are constantly working on your car, until finally it stops. Now it may be too late to fix it, and it will require a lot more energy. So everyday care is very important. Then you can get rid of your misunderstandings and know what you are actually doing.Thank you very much.If you go to a library you will see many books, and you can find out about our human knowledge that is so vast it is almost impossible to study. Now someone is going to land on the moon. Actually I don't know anything about how we are reaching the moon or what kind of feeling we will have when someone arrives there. To me it is not such an interesting thing. I want to speak about the moon trip, but I have not had any time to study it. So if I talk about the moon trip you may think, He is so ignorant. People I see today or tomorrow may speak about the moon trip as if they know everything about it. If I hear them speak about the moon trip, and I feel that they are not really interested, I may not respect them so much. The first one to arrive on the moon may be very proud of his achievement, but I do not think he is a great hero. I don't knowOhow you feel, but I don't feel that way. On television he may be a great hero for a time and be treated that way for his achievement. If we think about this, we immediately know how important it is to practice zazen. Instead of seeking for some success in the objective world, we try to experience the everyday moments of our life more deeply. That is the purpose of zazen. One time Marian Derby showed me some sand. When she gave it to me, she said, These are very interesting stones. It just looked like sand, but she asked me to look through a magnifying glass. Then those small stones were as interesting as the stones I have in my office. The stones in my office are bigger, but under the glass the sand was quite similar. If you say, This is a rock from the moon, you will be very much interested in it. Actually I don't think there is a great difference between rocks we have on the earth and those on the moon. Even if you go to Mars, I think you will find the same rocks. I am quite sure about it. So if you want to find something interesting, instead of hopping around the universe like this, enjoy your life in every moment, observe what you have now, and truly live in your surroundings. Yesterday I went to visit an island owned by the Nature Conservancy where there are many kinds of animals, birds, and fish. It was a very interesting place. If you live in an area like that and really start to see things, to see the plants and animals in that area, you may want to stay there your whole life. It is such an interesting place. But we human beings go hopping around, ignoring many interesting things. We may even travel to the moon or beyond. It is rather foolish. If you stay in one place, you can enjoy your life completely. That is a more human life. When we go to the moon I am not sure we are following the best direction for human beings. I don't know what we are doing. When we find the spirit of zazen, we find the way of life Y Eto follow as a human being. In other words, we are not fooled by things or fooled by some particular idea. Dogen Zenji at fir. refused to receive an honorary purple robe from the Emperor. After he turned it down a second time the Emperor said, You must receive it. So finally he accepted it. But he didn't wear it, and he wrote to the Emperor saying, I very much appreciate your purple robe, but I do not dare wear it, because if I wore it, the birds and monkeys on this mountain would laugh at me. In meditation we sometimes practice counting our breath. You may think it is silly to count your breath from one to ten, losing track of the count and starting over. If you use a computer, there will not be any mistake. But the underlying spirit is quite important. While we are counting each number, we find that our life is limitlessly deep. If we count our breath in the ordinary way, as we would count the distance from here to the moon, our practice doesn't mean anything. To count each breath is to breathe with our whole mind and body. We count each number with the power of the whole universe. So when you really experience counting your breath, you will have deep gratitude, more than if you arrived on the moon. You will not be so interested in something just because it is considered great, or uninterested in something usually considered to be small. Sti you may be very interested in having new experiences the way a baby is. A baby has the same basic attitude of interest towards all things. If you watch her, she will always be enjoying her life. We adults mosdy are caught by our preconceived ideas. We are not completely free from the objective world, because we are not one with the objective world. Things change. For the usual person this is very discouraging. You cannot rely on anything. You cannot have anything. And you will see what you don't want to see. You will meet someone Oyou don't like. If you want to do something, you may find that it is impossible. So you will be discouraged by the way things are going. As a Buddhist you are changing the foundation of your life. That things change is the reason why you suffer in this world and become discouraged. When you change your understanding and your way of living, then you can completely enjoy your new life in each moment. The evanescence of things is the reason why you enjoy your life. When you practice in this way, your life becomes stable and meaningful. So the point is to change your understanding of life and to practice with the right understanding. To arrive on the moon may be a great, historical event, but if we don't change our understanding of life, it won't have much meaning or make much sense. We need to have a deeper understanding of life. We say there is a Rinzai way and a Soto way, Hinayana practice and Mahayana practice, Buddhism and Christianity. But if you practice any of these as though you are hopping around the universe, it will not help much. If you have right understanding in your practice, then whether you take a train, an airplane, or a ship, you can enjoy your trip. If you go to Japan by boat, it may take ten days, and by airplane, maybe ten hours. But if the point is to enjoy your trip, time is not a concern. Even though you make a trip by airplane, you cannot live a thousand years. You only live one hundred years at most. And you cannot repeat your life. So you cannot compare your life with any other life. The only way is to enjoy your life. Even though you are practicing zazen, counting your breath like a snail, you can enjoy your life, perhaps even more than taking a trip to the moon. That is why we practice zazen. The most important thing is to be able to enjoy your life without being fooled by things.Thank you very much.Walk like an ElephantAll the teachings come from practicing zazen, where Buddha's mind is transmitted to us. To sit is to open up our transmitted mind, and all the treasures we experience come from this mind. To realize our true mind or transmitted mind, we practice zazen. Many people seek for a special place, and become confused. As Dogen Zenji says, Why give up your own seat and wander about in the dusry realms of foreign countries When we are sightseeing, we are involved in an idea of hasry attainment. Our way is to go step by step, appreciating our everyday life. Then we can see what we are doing where we are. People often think it would be best to study Zen in Japan, but this is rather difficult. Why don't you stay at Zen Center I ask them. If you go to Japan, mostly you will encourage them to build more new buildings. They may be very happy to see you, but it is a waste of time and money, and you will be discouraged because you cannot find a good Zen master. Even if you find a teacher, it will be difficult to understand him and to study with him.You can do true zazen practice here, watching yourself step byOl.Ostep, one step fier another. We practice like a cow rather than a horse. Instead of b'loping about, we walk slowly, like a cow or an elephant. If you can walk slowly, without any idea of gain, then you are already a good Zen student. In China at the end of the Sung Dynasty many Zen masters, responding to their students' desires, encoumged them to attain sudden enlightenmcnt using various psychological means. It may not be a trick I shall be scolded if I say trick but I feel that kind of practice is something like a trick. So those Zen masters would be good friends with the psychologists who try to explain the enlightcnment experience. But originally Zen was completely different from this kind of practice. Dogen Zeryi makes this point strongly, referring to a story about the first ancestor in China, Bodhidharma, and the second ancestor Taiso Eka. Bodhidharma tells Eka, If you want to enter our practice, cut yourself off from outward objects and stop your emotional and thinking activity within. When you become like a brick or stone wall, you will enter the Way. For Eka, this was a very difficult practice, as you must have experienced, but he tried very hard until he finally thought he understood what Bodhidharma meant. Then Eka told Bodhidharma that there was no break, no gap in his practice, never any ces.oation of practice. And Bodhidharma said, Then who are you Who does constant practice Eka said, Because I know myself very well, it is difficult to say who I am. And Bodhidhanna said, That's right. You are my disciple. Do you understand We do not practice zazen to attain enlightenment, but mther to express our true nature. Even your thinking is an expression of your true nature when you are prncticing zazen. Your thinking is like someone talking in the backyard or across the street. You :PliImay wonder what they are talking about, but that someone is not a particular person. That someone is our true nature. The true nature within us is always talking about Buddhism. Whatever we do is an expression of Buddha nature. When Eka, the second ancestor, came to this point, he told Bodhidharma that he thought he understood: A stone wall itself is Buddha nature a brick is also Buddha nature. Everything is an expression of Buddha nature. I used to think that after attaining enlightenment, I would know who is in the backyard talking, but there is no special person hidden within who is explaining a special teaching. All the things we see, all that we hear, is an expression of Buddha nature. When we say Buddha nature, Buddha nature is everything. Buddha nature is our innate true nature, which is universal to everyone of us, to all beings. In this way we realize our true nature is constantly doing something. So Eka says that there is no cessation in practice because it is Buddha's practice, which has no beginning and no end. Then who is practicing that kind of practice Personally he may be Eka, but his practice is constant and everlasting. It started in the beginningles. past and will end in the endles. future. So it is difficult to say who is practicing our way. When we practice zazen, we are practicing with all the ancestors. You should clearly know this point. You cannot waste your time, even though your zazen is not so good. You may not even understand what it is, but someday, sometime, someone will accept your practice. So just practice without wandering, without being involved in sightseeing zazen. Then you have a chance to join our practice. Good or bad doesn't matter. If you sit with this understanding, having conviction in your Buddha nature, then sooner or later you will find yourself in the midst of great Zen masters. So the important point is to practice without any idea of a hasty gain, without any idea of fame or profit. We do not practice zazen for the sake of others or for the sake of ourselves. Just practice zazen for the sake of zazen. Just sit.Thank you very much.Letters from EmptinessLetters from EmptinessShikantaza is to practice or actualize emptiness. Although you can have a tentative understanding of it through your thinking, you should understand emptiness through your experience. You have an idea of emptiness and an idea of being, and you think that being and emptiness are opposites. But in Buddhism both of these are ideas of being. The emptiness we mean is not like the idea you may have. You cannot reach a full understanding of emptiness with your thinking mind or with your feeling. That is why we practice zazen. We have a term sl.osokll, which is about the feeling you have when you receive a letter from home. Even without an actual picture, you know something about your home, what people are doing there, or which flowers are blooming. That is sl.osokll. Although we have no actual written communications from the world of emptiness, we have some hints or suggestions about what is going on in that world and that is, you might say, enlightenment. When you see plum blossoms, or hear the sound Oof a small stone hitting bamboo, that is a letter from the world of emptiness. Besides the world which we can describe, there is another kind of world. All descriptions of reality are limited expressions of the world of emptiness. Yet we attach to the descriptions and think they are reality. That is a mistake because what is described is not the actual reality, and when you think it is reality, your own idea is involved. That is an idea of self. Many Buddhists have made this mistake. That is why they were attached to written scriptures or Buddha's words. They thought that his words were the most valuable thing, and that the way to preserve the teaching was to remember what Buddha said. But what Buddha said was just a letter from the world of emptiness,just a suggestion or some help from him. If someone else reads it, it may not make sense. That is the nature of Buddha's words. To understand Buddha's words, we cannot rely on our usual thinking mind. If you want to read a letter from the Buddha's world, it is necessary to understand Buddha's world. To empty water from a cup does not mean to drink it up. To empty means to have direct, pure experience without relying on the form or color of being. So our experience is empty of our preconceived ideas, our idea of being, our idea of big or small, round or square. Round or square, big or small don't belong to reality but are simply ideas. That is to empty water. We have no idea of water even though we see it. When we analyze our experience, we have ideas of time or space, big or small, heavy or light. A scale of some kind is necessary, and with various scales in our mind, we experience things. Still the thing itself has no scale. That is something we add to reality. Because we always use a scale and depend on it so much, we think the scale really exists. But it doesn't exist. If it did, it would exist with things. Using a scale you can analyze one fM ..Sreality into entities, big and small, but as soon as we conceptualize something it is already a dead experience. We empty ideas of big or small, good or bad from our experience, because the measurement that we use is usually based on the self. When we say good or bad, the scale is yourself. That scale is not always the same. Each person has a scale that is different. So I don't say that the scale is always wrong, but we are liable to use our selfish scale when we analyze, or when we have an idea about something. That selfish part should be empty. How we empty that part is to practice zazen and become more accustomed to accepting thillgs as it is without any idea of big or small, good or bad. For artists or writers to express their direct experience, they may paint or write. But if their experience is very strong and pure, they may give up trying to describe it: Oh my. That is all. I like making a miniature garden around my house, but if I go to the stream and see the wonderful rocks and water running, I give up: Oh, no, I shall never try to make a rock garden. It is much better to clean up Tassajara Creek, picking up any paper or fallen branches. In nature itself there is beauty that is beyond beauty. When you see a part of it, you may think this rock should be moved one way, and that rock should be moved another way, and then it will be a complete garden. Because you limit the actual reality using the scale of your small self, there is either a good garden or a bad garden, and you want to change some stones. But if you see the thing itself as it is with a wider mind, there is no need to do anything. The thing itself is emptiness, but because you add something to it, you spoil the actual reality. So if we don't spoil things, that is to empty things. When you sit in shikantaza, don't be disturbed by sound, don't operate your thinking mind. This means not to Orely on any sense organ or the thinking mind and just receive the letter from the world of emptiness. That is shikamaza. To empty is not the same as to deny. Usually when we deny something, we want to replace it with something else. When I deny the blue cup, it means I want the white cup. When you argue and deny someone else's opinion, you are forcing your own opinion on another. That is what we usually do. Hut our way is not like that. By emptying the added element of our selfcentered ideas, we purify our observation of things. When we see and accept things as they are, we have no need to replace one thing with another. That is what we mean by to empty things. If we empty things, lening them be as t s, then things will work. Originally things are related and things are one, and as one being it will extend itself. To let it extend itself, we empty things. When we have this kind of attitude, then without any idea of religion we have religion. When this attitude is missing in our religious practice, it will naturally become like opium. To purify our experience and to observe tlrIgs as t s is to understand the world of emptiness and to understand why Buddha left so many teachings. In our practice of shikantaza we do not seek for anything, because when we seek for something, an idea of self is involved. Then we try to achieve something to further the idea of self. That is what you are doing when you make some effort, but our effort is to get rid of selfcentered activity. That is how we purify our experience. For instance, if you are reading, your wife or husband may say, Would you like to have a cup of tea Oh, am busy, you may say, don't bother me. When you are reading in that way, I think you should be careful. You should be ready to say, Yes, that would be wonderful, please bring me a cup of tea. Then you stop reading and have a cup of tea. After having a cup of tea, you continue your reading. . Otherwise your attitude is, I am very busy right now! That is not so good, because then your mind is not actually in fu function. A pan of your mind is working hard, but the other part may not be working so hard. You may be losing your balance in your activity. If it is reading, it may be okay, but if you are making calligraphy and your mind is not in a state of emptines., your work will te you, I am not in a state of emptiness. So you should stop. If you are a Zen student you should be ashamed of making such calligraphy. To make calligraphy is to practice zazen. So when you are working on calligraphy, if someone says, Please have a cup of tea, and you answer, No, I am making calligraphy! then your calligraphy will say, No, no! You cannot fool yourself. I want you to understand what we are doing here at Zen Center. Sometimes it may be a right to practice zazen as a kind of exercise or training, to make your practice stronger or to make your breathing smooth and natural. That is perhaps included in practice, but when we say shikantaza, that is not what we mean. When we receive a letter from the world of emptiness, then the practice of shikantaza is working.Thank you very much.Brown Rice is just RightHow do you like zazen I think it may be better to ask, how do you like brown rice Zazen is too big a topic. Drown rice is just right. Actually, there is not much difference. When you eat brown rice, you have to chew it, and unless you chew it, it is difficult to swallow. When you chew it very well, your mouth becomes part oC the kitchen, and actually the brown rice becomes more and more tasty. When we eat white rice, we don't chew so much, but that little bit of chewing feels so good that naturally the rice goes right down our throats. When we digest food completely, what will become of it It will be transformed, changing its chemical nature, and will permeate our whole body. In the process it dies within our body. To eat and digest food is natural to us, as we are always changing. This organic proces. is called emptiness. The reason we call it emptiness is that it has no special Corm. It has some form, but that form is not permanent. While it is changing, it carries on our life energy. We know that we are empty, and also that this earth is empty. The forms are not permanent. You may wonder, What is this Tuniverse Dut this universe has no limit. Emptiness is not something you can understand through a space trip. Emptiness can be understood when you are perfectly involved in chewing rice. This is actual emptiness. The most important point is to establish yourself in a true sense, without establishing yourself on delusion. And yet we cannot live or practice without delusion. Delusion is necessary, but delusion is not something on which you can establish yourself. It is like a stepladder. Without it you cannot climb up, but you don't stay on the stepladder. With this confidence, you can continue to study our way. That is why I say, Don't run away. Stick with me. I do not mean, Stick to me. I mean stick with yourself, not with delusion. Sometimes I may be a delusion. You may overestimate me: He is a good teacher! That is already a kind of delusion. I am your friend. I am just practicing with you as your friend who has many stepladders. We shouldn't be disappointed with a bad teacher or with a bad student. You know, if a bad student and a bad teacher strive for the truth, something real will be established. That is our zazen. We must continue to practice zazen and continue to chew brown rice. EventuaUy, we will accomplish something.Thank you very much.The Zen of Goingto the Rest RoomHow do you feel right now Ilaughs I don't know how you feel, but I feel as if I have just come out of the rest room. As I am pretty old, I go to the rest room often. Even when I was young, I went to the rest room more often than others, and sometimes I had an advantage because of that. When I went to Eiheiji Monastery and sat Idllgaryo a period of continuous sitting for several days, required for entering a Zen monastery, I could go to the rest room without a guilty conscience, because I had to! I was so happy to go to the rest room. I think that going to the rest room is a good way to look at our practice. Zen master Unullon may have been the first to make a connection between our practice and the rest room. What is your practice What is Buddha someone asked him. He answered, Toilet paper. Actually, nowadays it is toilet paper, but he said, Something to wipe yourself with in the rest room. That is what he said. And since then many Zen masters are Tif.OfMthinking about it, practicing with the koan: What is toilet paperWhat did he mean by that In our everyday life, we eat many things, good and bad, fancy and simple, tasty and not so tasty. Later we need to go to the rest room. Similarly after filling our mind, we practice zazen. Otherwise our thinking will eventually become very unhealthy. It is necessary for us to make our mind clear before we study something. It is like drawing something on white paper if you do not use clean white paper, you cannot draw what you want. So it is necessary to go back to your original state where you have nothing to see and nothing to think about. Then you will understand what you are doing. The more you practice zazen, the more you will be interested in your everyday life. You will discover what is necessary and what is not what part to correct and what part to emphasize more. So by practice you will know how to organize your life. This is to observe your situation accurately, to clear your mind and begin from your original starting point. This is like going to the rest room. Our culture is based on the idea of gaining or accumulating something. Science, for instance, is the accumulation of knowledge. I don't know that a modern scientist is greater than a scientist in the sixteenth century. The difference is that we have accumulated our scientific knowledge. That is a good point and at the same time dangerous. We are in danger of being buried under a of our accumulated knowledge. It is like trying to survive without going to the rest room. We are already swimming in the pond of polluted water and air, and we talk about this pollution. At the same time we can hardly survive the pollution of our knowledge. Each one of us knows how to go to the rest room without attaching to something we have in our bodies. When we realize .Othat we already have everything, we will not be attached to anything. Actually, we have everything. Even without going to the moon, we have it. When we try to go to the moon, it means that we think the moon is not ours. Our mind, as Buddha told us, is one with everything. Within our mind, everything exists. If we understand things in this way, then we will understand our activity. To study something is to appreciate something. To appreciate something is to be detached from things. When we become detached from things, everything will be ours. Our practice is to realize this kind of big mind in other words, to go beyond each being including ourselves, and let our self work as it works. That is zazen practice. When we practice zazen, we actually clean up our various attachments. We are very much afraid of death. But when we are mature enough, we understand that death is something that should happen to us. If you die when you are young, that is a terrible thing. If I die, it is not such a terrible thing, either for me or for you, because I am mature enough to die. I understand my life pretty well, what it is to live one day and what it is to live one year, and what it is to live sixty or one hundred years. So anyway, when you become mature and experienced, having eaten many things in this life, I think you will be happy to die,just as you are happy to go to the rest room. It happens in that way. An old person, eighty or ninety, hasn't many problems. Physically, old people may suffer, but that suffering is not as big a thing as you think. When people are young they think about death as something terrible, so when they are dying they continue to think that. But actually, it isn't. There is some limit to our capacity to endure physical suffering. And mentally there is a limit to our capacity, but we think it is limitless. We have limitless suffering because we have limitless desire. That kind of desire, as Buddha says, creates our problems. We are accumulating our problems one after another with limitless desire, so we have bottomless fear. ..Jlfi M Actually, when we know how to clear up our mind, we will not have as many problems. Just as we go to the rest room every day, we practice zazen every day. n monastic life, the best practice is to clean the rest room. Wherever you go, whichever monastery you go to, you will always find a special person cleaning the rest room. We do not clean our rest room just because it is dirty. Whether it is clean or not, we clean the rest room, until we can do it without any idea of clean or dirty. When that is so, it is actually our zazen practice. To extend this practice to everyday life may seem difficult, but actually it is quite simple. Our laziness makes it difficult, that's a. That is why we put emphasis on endurance, to continue our practice. There should not be any cessation of practice practice should go on, one moment after another. Some students who practice zazen very hard are liable to ignore everyday life. f someone auaill enlightenment, they may say,. have auained enlightenment under a great Zen master, so whatever do is okay. have complete freedom from good and bad. Only those who do not have an enlightenment experience stick to the idea of good and bad. Speaking in that way is to ignore everyday life. They do not take care of their life. They do not know how to organize their life or know what kind of rhythm they should have. To know the rhythm of our lives is to understand what we are doing. t is necessary to sec our activity with a clear mind, through zazen experience. came to America because in Japan had too many problems. 'm not sure, but perhaps that is why I came to America. When was in Japan, didn't practice zazen as do here. Now have very different problems than I had in Japan. Even though I am practicing zazen with you, my mind is like a garbage can. Even though I am in America, which is called a free country, my mind is like a garbage can. I am a Japanese and have many Japanese friends here, so have the problems most Japanese have, in addi .Otion to other problems. Sometimes I wonder what I am doing here. Uut when I know what I am doing clearly, without any overestimation or underestimation, very honestly and truly, I do not have much burden on my mind. Zazen practice especially has been a great help. If I hadn't been practicing zazen, I wouldn't have survived in the way I did. I started my practice when I was quite young. But even more, I started my practice in its true sense after I came to San Francisco. You may have a pretty difficult time with me. I know that what I am doing is challenging for you. But this effort to understand things from another angle is not possible without conununicating with people who are brought up in a different cultural background. To understand things just from a selfcentered personal or national viewpoint is our weakness, and when we do that we cannot develop our culture in its true sense. When our culture comes to this point, the only way to make it healthy is to participate in the cultural activities of various human beings. Then you will understand yourself better, as I understand myself and zazen better since I came to San Francisco. When you understand yourself better and others better, you can just be yourself. Just to be a good American is to be a good Japanese, and just to be a good Japanese is to be a good American. Because we stick to Japanese way or American way, our mind becomes like a wastepaper basket. If you notice this point, you will understand how important it is to practice zazen. Fortunately or unfortunately, even though you don't like it, we need to go to the rest room, the stinky rest room. I am sorry, but I think we have to go to the rest room, as long as we live. If I were younger,l would sing a Japanese folk song right now, about the rest room.Thank you very much.Caring for the SoilMost of us study Buddhism as though it were something that was already given to us. We think that what we should do is preserve the Buddha's teaching, like putting food in the refrigerator. Then to study Buddhism we take the food out of the refrigerator. Whenever you want it, it is already there. Instead. Zen students should be interested in how to produce food from the field. from the garden. We put the emphasis on the ground. of us have Buddha nature. and the teachings that grow from Buddha nature are similar to one another. The teachings of different schools of Buddhism do not differ so much. but the attitude towards the teaching is different. When you think that the teaching is already given to you then. naturally. your effort will be to apply the teaching in this conullon world. For instance. Theravada students apply the teaching of the twelve Links of Causation ignorance. will. mind. name and form. six senses. contact. acceptance. love. attachment. being. birth. death to our acruallife. to how we were born and how we die. Mahayana understanding is that the original purpose of this teaching. when Buddha told it. vas to explain the interdependency of different beings.Buddha tried to save us by destroying our common sense.Usually we are not interested in the nothingness of the ground. Our tendency is to be interested in something that is growing ill the garden, not in the bare soil itself. nut if you want to have a good harvest the most important thing is to make the soil rich and to cultivate it we. The Buddha's teaching is not about the food itself but about how it is grown, and how to take care of it. Buddha was not interested in a special deity or in something that was already there he was interested in the ground from which various gardens will appear. For him, everything was holy. Buddha did not think of himself as a special persoll. He tried to be like the most common persoll, wearing a robe, begging with a bowl. He thought, have many students because the students are very good, not because of me. Buddha was great because his understanding of people was good. necause he understood people he loved them, and he enjoyed helping them. Because he had that kind of spirit, he could be a Buddha.Thank you very much.Everyday Life is like a MovieI think most of you are rather curious about what Zen is. Zen is actually our way of life. and to practice zazen is like setting your alarm clock. Unless you set your alarm. the clock will not serve its purpose. Every day we must have a starting point. The sun rises at a certain time and sets at a certain time. always repeating the same thing. And we do too, but it may not feel that way to us. Unless our life is organized. we may not realize how important it is to know where to start our life. As Zen students our life begins with zazen practice. We come back to zero and start from zero. Although we have various activities. the most important thing is to realize how these activities arise from zero. At the moment you decide to sit. it means that you have already set your alarm. When you have enough confidence to make the decision to start practicing zazen, that is zero. During zazen you may hear a bird singing. Something is arising in your practice. In the same way in our everyday life many things will arise, and if you know where these things arise from, Oyou will not be disturbed by them. Because you don't know how it happens, you become confused. If you know how things arise, then at the moment something happens you will be ready: Oh, something is arising. It is like watching the sunrise: Oh look, the sun is just coming up. For instance sometimes you will be angry, but anger actually doesn't come a of a sudden. It may come very slowly. When you feel anger come all of a sudden,that is real anger. Dut when you know how it comesanger is arising in my mindthat is not anger. People may say that you are angry, but actually you are not angry. If you know you are about to start crying, Oh, I am going to cry, and then in the next rwo or three minutes, Oh, started crying, that is not crying. Our practice is to accept things as you accept various images in your siuing. The most importam thing is to have big mind and to accept things. If you practice zazen to obtain enlightenmem, it will be like using an alarm clock without selling the time. I will go of anyway, but it doesn't make much sense. To sit every morning at a certain time makes sense. To know what you are doing at any particular time is the most importam thing. This is to make efTort according to the situation you are in. Our everyday life is like a movie playing on the wide screen. Most people are imerested in the picture on the screen without realizing there is a screen. When the movie stops and you don't see anything anymore, you think, I must come again tomorrow evening. Iaughsl . will come back and see another show. When you are just imerested in the movie on the screen and it ends, then you expect another show tomorrow, or maybe you are discouraged because there is nothing good on right now. You don't realize the screen is always there. I when you are practicing, you realize that your mind is like a screen. If the screen is colorful, colorful enough to auract ..people, then it will not serve its purpose. So to have a screen which is not colorfulto have a pure, plain white screen is the most important point. But most people are not interested in the pure white screen. I think it is good to be excited by seeing a movie. To some extent you can enjoy the movie because you know that it is a movie. Even though you have no idea of the screen, still your interest is based on an understanding that this is a movie with a screen and there is a projector or something artificial. So you can enjoy it. That is how we enjoy our life. If you have no idea of the screen or the projector, perhaps you cannot see it as a movie. Zazen practice is neces.ary to know the kind of screen you have and to enjoy your life as you enjoy movies in the theater. You are not afraid of the screen. You do not have any particular feeling for the screen, which is just a white screen. So you are not afraid of your life at a. You enjoy something you are afraid of. You enjoy something that makes you angry or makes you cry, and you enjoy the crying and the anger too. If you have no idea of the screen, then you will even be afraid of enlightenment: What is it Oh, my! naughterJ If someone attains enlightenment, you may ask him about the experience that he had. When you hear about the experience, you may say, Oh, no! That is not for me. But it is just a movie you know, something for you to enjoy. And if you want to enjoy the movie you should know that it is the combination of film and light and screen, and that the most important thing is the plain white screen. That white screen is not something that you can actually attain it is something you always have. The reason you don't feel you have it is because your mind is too busy. Once in a while you should stop all your activities and make your screen white. That is zazen. That is the foundation of our everyday life and our sOmeditation practice. Without this kind of foundation your practice will not work. All the instructions you receive are about how to have a clean white screen, even though it is never pure white because of various attachments and previous stains. When we just practice zazen with no idea of anything, we are quite relaxed. Because it is difficult to have complete relaxation in our usual posture, we take the posture of zazen. To do this we follow the instructions that have been accumulated from the experience of many people in the past. They discovered that the posture of zazen is much better than other postures, better than standing up or lying down. If you practice zazen following the instructions, it will work. But if you do not trust your own pure white screen, your practice will not work.Thank you very much.Resuming Big MindThe purpose of sesshin is to be completely one with our practice. We use two Chinese characters for sessl,ill. I which shortens to ses in conjunction with slrill means to treat something the way you treat a guest or the way a student treats his teacher. Another meaning of selSll is to control or to arrange things in order. ,ill means mind or heart. So sessl,ill means to have proper functioning of mind. It is our five senses and our will, or sma monkey mind, which should be controUed. When we control our monkey mind we resume our true big mind. When monkey mind is always taking over the activity of big mind, we naturaUy become a monkey. So monkey mind must have its boss, which is big mind. However, when we practice zazen, it is not that big mind is actually controUing sma mind, but simply that when sma mind becomes calm, big mind starts its true activity. Most of the time in our everyday life, we are involved in the activity of small mind. That is why we should practice zazen and be completely involved in resuming big mind.A good example of our practice is a turtle, which has four Olegs, a head, and a tailsix parts of the body which are sometimes outside of the shell and sometimes inside. When you want to eat or go somewhere, your legs are out, but if they are always out, you will be caught by something. In case of danger, you draw in your legs, head, and tail. The six parts refer to the five senses and the mind. This is sesshin. For one week, our head, tail, and legs are inside the shell. In the scriptures it says that even demons cannot destroy us if the six parts of our body are inside the shell. In zazen we do not try to stop thinking or cut off hearing and seeing. If something appears in your mind, leave it. If you hear something, hear it, and just accept it. Ohthat is all. No second activity should appear in your zazen. Sound is one activity. The second activity is, What is that sound is it a motor car or garbage truck or something If you hear a sound, that is allyou hear it. Don't make any judgment. Don't try to figure out what it is. Just open your ears and hear something. Just open your eyes and see something. When you are sitting for a pretty long time, watching the same place on the wa, you may see various images: It looks like a river, or it looks like a dragon. Then you may think that you should not be thinking, but you see various things. DweUing on the images may be a good way to kill time, but it is not sesshin. To be concentrated on something may be important, but just to have a weUconcentrated mind is not zazen. It is one of the elements of practice, but calmness of mind is also necessary, so don't intensify the activity of the five sense organs. Just leave them as they are. That is how to free your true mind. When you can do so in everyday life you will have a soft mind. You won't have many preconceived ideas, and the bad habits in your way of thinking will not be overpowering. You will have generous mind and big mind, and what you say will help others. . For example, in the Silobogfllzozilloki Dogen Zenji tells a story, which was told to him, about an influential person, Ichijo Motoie. One day Motoie discovered that his sword was missing, and since no one else could have broken imo his house, one of his own men must have stolen it. The sword was found and brought back to him, but Motoie said, This is not my sword, so give it back to the one who owns it. People knew that the man who had the sword was the one who had stolen it, but because Motoie didn't accuse him of it, no one could say anything, so nothing happened. This is the calmness of mind we should have, according to Dogen. If we have generous, big mind, and if we have a strong spirit of practice, then there is no need to worry. Dogen emphasized a sparse, simple life. Without expecting anything, we just practice our way. Many students asked how it would be possible to support the temple or group without any plan, and he said, If it becomes difficult to support our temple, we will think about it, but until then, it is not neces..ary to think about it. So before something happens, it is not our way to think about it too much. In that way we have complete calmness of our mind. Because you have something, you worry about losing it, but if you don't have anything, there is no need to worry. One night Dogen said, Even if you think a teaching is complete and right, when someone tells you a better way, you should change your understanding. In this way, we improve our understanding of the teaching forever. Because you think it is right at that time, you follow the theory or rules, but you also have some space in your mind to change your idea. That is soft mind. It is possible to change your ideas because you know what kind of monkey your thinking is. Sometimes you follow the monkey's suggestion Oh yeah, that's right. If we go in that direction, we Omay get sOllie food. Okay, let's go! But when you see a better way to go, you may say, Oh monkey, it may be better to go this way! If you stick to your greed or anger or some other emotion, if you stick to the thinking mind, your monkey mind, you cannot change. Your mind is not soft. So in our practice, we rely on something great, and sit in that great space. The pain you have in your legs or some other difficulty is happening in that great space. As long as you do not lose the feeling that you are in the realm of Buddha nature, you can sit even though you have some difficulty. When you want to escape from your difficulty, or when you try to improve your practice, you create another problem Cor yourself. But if you just exist there, then you have a chance to appreciate your surroundings, and you can accept yourself completely, without changing anything. That is our practice. To exist in big mind is an act of faith, which is different from the usual faith of believing in a particular idea or being. It is to believe that something is supporting us and supporting all our activities including thinking mind and emotional feelings. All these things are supported by something big that has no form or color. It is impossible to know what it is, but something exists there, something that is neither material nor spiritual. Something like that always exists, and we exist in that space. That is the feeling of pure being. If you are brave enough to throw yourself into zazen for seven days, a little bit of understanding will help your rigidity and your stubbornness. Almost a the problems you create because of your stubborn mind will vanish. If you have even the smaUest understanding of reality, your way oC thinking will change completely, and the problems you create will not be problems anymore. But it is also true that as long as we live we will have Dproblems. So we don't practice zazen to attain some big enlightenment that will change our whole being or solve all our problems. That is not the right understanding. That may be what people call Zen, but true Zen is not like that. In sesshin, we concentrate on having the experience of true practice. Forgetting all about any idea of gaining anything, we just sit here. If this room is too cold, we will make it warm, and if your legs become painful, you can stretch them. And if it is too difficult, you can rest, but let's continue our practice for these seven days.Thank you very much.Ordinary Mind, Buddha MindThe point of my talk is to give you some support for your practice. There is no need for you to remember what I say. If you stick to it, you stick to the support, not the tree ilef. A tree, when it is strong, may still want some support, but the most important thing is the tree itself, not the support. I am one tree, and each one of you is a tree. You should stand up by yourself. When a tree stands up by itself, we call that tree a Buddha. In other words, when you practice zazen in its true sense, you are really Buddha. Sometimes we call it a tree and sometimes we ca it a Buddha. Buddha, tree, or you are many names of one Buddha. When you sit. you are independent from various beings. and you are related to various beings. And when you have perfect composure in your practice. you include everything. You are not just you. You are the whole world or the whole cosmos. and you are a Buddha. So when you sit. you are an ordinary human. and you are Buddha. Before you sit. you may stick to the idea that you are ordinary. So when you sit you are not the same being as you arc before you sit. Do you understand You may say that it is not possible to be ordinary and holy. When you think this way, your understanding is onesided. In Japanese, we ca someone who understands things from just one side a Itllllbtlllktlll. someone who carries a board on his shoulder. Because you carry a big board on your shoulder, you cannot see the other side. You think you are just an ordinary human, but if you take the board off, you will understand, Oh, I am Buddha, too. How can I be both Buddha and an ordinary human It is amazing! That is enlightenment. When you experience enlightenment, you will understand things more rreely. You won't mind whatever people ca you. Ordinary mind Okay, I am ordinary mind. Buddha Yes, I am Buddha. How do I come to be both Buddha and ordinary mind I don't know, but actually I am Buddha and ordinary mind. Buddha, in its true sense, is not different from ordinary mind. And ordinary mind is not something apart from what is holy. This is a complete understanding or our selr. When we practice zazen with this understanding, that is true zazen. We will not be bothered by anything. Whatever you hear, whatever you see, that will be okay. To have this feeling, it is necessary to become accustomed to our practice. If you keep practicing, you will naturally have this understanding and this feeling. It will not be just intellectual. You will have the actual feeling. Even though someone can explain what Buddhism is, if he does not have the actual feeling, we cannot ca him a real Buddhist. Only when your personality is characterized by this kind of feeling can we ca you a Buddhist. The way to become characterized by this kind of understanding is to always concentrate on this point. Many koans and sayings bring out this point. I Ordinary mind understands things dualistically, but even though we are doing what we usually do, that is actually Buddha's activity. Buddha's mind, Buddha's activity, and our activity are not different. Someone may say that such and such is Buddha's mind, and thus and so is ordinary mind, but there is no need to explain it in that way. When we do something, we cannot say, I am doing something, because there is no one who is independent from others. When I say something, you will hear it. I cannot do anything by myself, just for myself. If someone does something, everyone will be doing something. Moment after moment, we continue our activity, which is Buddha's activity. But you cannot say that this is just Buddha's activity, because you are actually doing something too. Then you may say , but we don't know what I that is. You try to say who is doing what, because you want to intellectualize your activity, but before you say anything, the actual activity is present. Who you are is here. Our activity is both cosmic and personal, so there is no need to explain what we are doing. We may want to explain it, but we should not feel uneasy if we cannot, because it is impossible to understand. Actually, you are here, right here, so before you understand yourself, you are you. After you explain, you are not really you anymore. You just have an image. But usually you will stick to the image which is not you, and you will ignore the reality. As Dogen Zenji said, we human beings allach to something that is not real and forget all about what is real. That is actually what we do. If you realize this point, you will have perfect composure, and you can trust yourself. Whatever happens to you, it doesn't mailer. You trust yourself, and this is not the usual trust or belief in what is not real. When you are able to sit without any image or any sound, with an open mind, that is true practice. When you can do that, you ,,are free from everything. Still it is a right for you to elUoy your life, moment after moment, because you arc not enjoying your life as something concrete and eternal. Our life is momentary, and, at the same time, each moment includes its own past and future. In this way our momentary and eternal life will continue. This is how we actually lead our everyday life, how we enjoy our everyday life, and how we have freedom from variolls difficulties. I was sick in bed for a long time, and I was thinking about these things. I was just practicing zazen in bed. I should enjoy being in bed. laughing Sometimes it was difficult, but then I laughed at myself, Why is it so difficult Why don't you enjoy your difficultiesThat is, I think, our practice.Thank you very much.Practicing Zenelllal ali,de. Supported from WithinIn our service after reciting a sutra, we offer a prayer to dedicate the merit. According to Dogen Zenji we are not seeking for help from outside because we are firmly protected from inside. That is our spirit. We are protected from inside, always, incessantly, so we do not expect any help from outside. Actually it is so, but when we recite the sutra, we say a prayer in the usual way. In one of our dedications of merit we say, May the two heels the Dharma wheel and the material wheel of the temple go smoothly and may the calamities which the country and the temple may face, calamities like war, epidemic, famine, fire, water, and wind, be averted. Although we say this, actually the spirit is different. We do not observe our way, or recite our sutra to ask for help. That is not our spirit. When we recite the sutra, we create the feeling of nonduality, perfect calmness, and strong conviction in our practice. If that kind of feeling is always with us we will be supported. If we become involved in dualistic, selfish practice, to support our building or organization, or to support our personal life, there is not much feeling in our sitting or our chanting. When we have . . Ostrong confidence in our way and do not expect anything, we can recite the sutra with a deep cairn feeling. That is our actual practice. Dogen Zenji also says that we do not have any idea of dirty or pure, or any idea of calamity or disaster, but even so, we have the practice of cleaning the rest room. Even though your face, or mouth, or body is clean, when you get up you should wash your face and clean your mouth. If you think cleaning the rest room is dirty work, that is the wrong idea. The rest room is not dirty. Even though you don't clean it, it is clean, or more than clean. So we clean it as a practice, not because it is dirty. If you do it because it is dirty, that is not our way. Our belief is that if the Dharma wheel is turning then the material wheel will be turning too. If we are not supported by anyone, it means our Dharma wheel is not actually going. This is Dogen Zenji's understanding, and I have tested whether it is true or not, especiaUy during the war when I did not have much to eat. Most priests worked to earn some money to support themselves and their families. My belief was that if I observed the Buddhist way faithfully, people would support me. If no one supported me it would mean that Dogen's words were not true. So I never asked anyone to give me anything. I just observed the Buddhist way without working as a teacher or as a clerk in the town office. I raised some vegetables and sweet potatoes in my temple garden. That is why I know how to raise vegetables pretty well. I had a spacious garden in front of the temple, so I dug up the ground, took out all the stones, and put in manure. Some villagers came and helped me, and we grew vegetables, and we had a good crop. One day my neighbor came to help me cook. When she opened the rice box, there was no rice at all. I had a pretty big 'rice box. She was astounded, so she brought me some rice. It was only a little, as she didn't have much rice, but then my neighbors and members of my temple coUected rice. I had quite a few members, so I had quite a lot of rice. When people found out that I had a lot of rice they came to the temple, so I gave my rice to them. The more I gave my rice to them, the more rice I was given. At that time most people who lived in the city went to the farming families and exchanged whatever possessions they could for food: potatoes, rice, sweet potatoes, or pumpkin. But I had no such difficulty. Most of the time I had plenty of food, but I didn't feel so good eating something different from other people, so I tried to eat the same food as they did. Here at Tas.ajara the fo'd is wonderful, strong and rich, in comparison to the food we had in wartime. So I have not had any complaint about the food. If we observe our way strictly we will surely be protected by Buddha. We will trust people, and we will trust Buddha. Since the war, Japanese priests have started to wear Western suits, giving up their Buddhist robes, unless they are performing a funeral or memorial service. I don't feel so good about that, so I always wear my robes. When I was coming to America, almost a the priests who were going abroad wore good suits and shiny shoes. They thought that in order to propagate Buddhism they had to be like the American people. But their heads were not shiny. Their hair was pretty long and we combed, rather than shaved . But even though they buy the best suits and the best shoes, Japanese are Japanese. They cannot be American people, and American people will find some fault in the way they wear their suits or shoes. That is one reason why I didn't come to America in a suit. Another reason was that I was disappointed with priests who changed their robes into suits to support themselves, when Dogen Osaid we are firmly protected from within. That is our spirit when we say, We pray that the Dharma wheel and the material wheel go smoothly forever. This kind of ceremony is a way to repay the benevolence of the Buddha and arhats. Buddha and the arhats are people who supported themselves by depending only on their practice. If we pay full respect to the arhats by practicing with the same spirit they did, we will also be protected. Dogen says, If we do not practice our way with everyone, with all sentient beings, with everything in the world, on the cosrnic stage, that is not the Buddhist way. The spirit of zazen practice should always be with us, especially when we recite sUlras or observe ceremonies. It is not a dualistic or selfish spirit, but is calm and deep, with firm conviction. When we practice in that way, we are always one with the whole Buddha world, where there is no karmic activity, and our everyday life will be protected by the kind of power which pervades everywhere. What is going on in the world of Buddha is just Buddha activity. There is nothing but Buddha activity in the realm of the Dharma world. In that way, we do not create any karma. We are beyond the karmic world. With this spirit and this understanding we observe our way. If we are too involved in the idea of time or taking care of the material world, we will lose our way. A priest will not be a priest when he is completely involved in dualistic practice, involved in a busy life in the busy, mundane world. Then there are no more priests. Even though priests are there, they are not practicing the priest's way. So Buddhists should be Buddhists completely. When a Buddhist really becomes a Buddhist he will be supported as a Buddhist.Thank you very much.Open Your IntuitionThe purpose of sesshin is to develop stable practice. In sesshin we do not communicate with words, but being with each other is still a big encouragement. Verbal communication tends to be superficial, but when you don't speak, deeper communication between you will be encouraged, and your mind will become very subtle. Staying silent will open your intuition. Just to stay here without speaking for five days is already very meaningful. That is why we do not talk. When you are involved in a superficial conversation based on a passing interest, your true feeling will be covered. So to open your innate nature and to feel something from the bottom of your heart, it is necessary to remain silent. Through this kind of practice you will have a more intuitive understanding of the teaching. Not to talk does not mean to be deaf and dumb, but to listen to your intuition. The same is true with reading. When you become interested in something you are reading, your intuition does not tend to Oopen. That is why we don't read during sesshill. It doesn't mean to confine yourself in the dark, but by not reading you will encourage your intuition to open. Even if you are doing koan practice, it is not neces.'kIry to speak or to read. Especially for beginners it may be difficult to remain silent or not to read the newspapers. You may feel very bored laughs, but you should continue your practice. In ses.hin, everything will be taken care of by the old students, who will help the newer students to practice deeply. Just sit, and see what happens. Try to keep the right posture, according to the instructions, and follow the rules. Following the rules lets you find yourself. The rules let you know what time it is, when to eat, and how to walk. If there are no rules, and no one is taking care of you, it is rather difficult to practice. So the rules will be a great help. It is much better than not having any rules and sitting in a corner of the room five days without doing anything. The rules are not something to restrict you, but something to support your practice. There are various ways to practice: following the breath, counting the breath, or koan practice. This time I recommend following the breath. When you find it difficult to follow the breath, then counting the breath will be a help. Then you will know exactly what you are doing. If your practice gets lost, you will notice immediately. When you practice following the breath, don't make too much effort to make your breathing slow down or deepen, or anything like that. If you just follow your breath, then naturally your breathing will be appropriate for your practice, even though you don't adjust it. Various instructions will be given to you to help your practice. We do not give instructions in order to force you to do some Nspecial practice.It does not mean you should do this, or youshouldn't do that.You Illay have various instructions, but practiceis up to you.Thank you very much.Find Out for YourselfIn your zazen or in your life you will have many difficuhies or problems. When you have a problem, see if you can find out for yourself why you have a problem. Usually you will try to solve your difficulty in the best way as soon as possible. Rather than studying for yourself, you ask someone why you have a problem. That kind of approach may work well for your usual life, but if you want to study Zen, it doesn't help. The moment you are told something by someone and you think you understand. you will stick to it, and you will lose the full function of your nature. When you seek something, your true nature is in full activity, as if you are feeling for your pillow in the dark. If you know where the pillow is, your mind is not in full function. Your mind is acting in a limited sense. When you are seeking for the pillow without knowing where it is, then your mind is open to everything. In this way you will have a more subtle attitude toward everything, and you will see Illillgs as il is.If you want to study something, it's better not to know whatFthe answer is. Because you are not satisfied with something you are told, and because you cannot rely on anything set up by someone else, you study Buddhism without knowing how to study it. In this way you find out for yourself what we reaUy mean by Buddha nature, practice' or enlightenment. Since you seek freedom, you try various ways. Of course you will sometimes find that you have wasted your time. If a Zen master drinks sake, you may think the best way to attain enlightenment is to drink sake. But even though you drink a lot of sake, as he does, you will not attain enlightenment. It may look like you've wasted your time, but that attitude is important. If you continue to try to find out in that way, you will gain more power to understand things. Whatever you do, you will not waste your time. When you do something with a limited idea, or with some definite purpose, what you will gain is something concrete. This will cover up your inner nature. So it is not a matter of what you study, but a matter of seeing 'ills il is, and accepting Il,illgs Sil is. Some of you may study something only if you like it. If you don't like it, you ignore it. That is a selfish way, and it also limits your power of study. Good or bad, small or big, we study to discover the true reason why something is so big and why something is so small why something is so good and why something is not so good. If you try to discover only something good, you will miss something, and you will always be limiting your faculties. When you live in a limited world, you cannot accept IlJillgs il is. Even if a Zen master had just two or three students, he would never tell them our way in detail. The only way to study with him is to eat with him, talk with him, and do everything with him. You help him without being told how to help him. Mostly he will not seem to be very happy, and he will always be scolding Oyou without any apparent reason. Because you cannot figure out the reason, you will not be so happy and he will not be so happy. If you reaUy want to study with him, you will study how to please him, how to make your life with him a happy one. You may say that this way of practice is very oldfashioned. It may be so, but I think you had this kind of life in Western civilization too, although not exactly as we did in Japan. The reason why people had a difficult time with their teachers is that there is no particular way for us to study. Each one of us is different from the other. So each one of us must have our own way, and, according to the situation, we should change our way. You cannot stick to anything. The only thing to do is to discover the appropriate way to act under new circumstances. For instance, in the morning we clean. We don't have enough rags or brooms, so it is almost impossible to participate in our cleaning. Under these circumstances it is sti possible to figure out something to do. I don't scold you very much, but if I were a strict Zen master I would be very angry with you, because you give up quite easily: Oh, no, there is not much cleaning equipment, or, There is nothing for me to do. You are prone to think this way and easily give up. In such a case, please try hard to figure out how to practice. If you are very sleepy, you may think, It's better to rest. Yes, sometimes it is better, but at the same time it may be a good chance to practice. When I was at Eiheiji assisting my teacher, he did not tell us anything, but whenever we made a mistake he scolded us. The usual way to open sliding doors is to open the one on the right, but when I opened it that way, I was scolded: Don't open it that way! Not that side! So the next morning I opened the other side and got scolded again. I didn't know what to do. Later I found out that the day I opened the right side his guest was on the right side, so I should have opened the other side. Before open fiNnRsnSing the door, I should have been careful to find out which side his guest was on. The day I was appointed to serve him, I gave him a cup of tea. Usually you fi eighty percent of the cup. Since that is the rule, I filled eighty percent, or seventy percent, and he said, Give me hot tea. Fill the cup with very hot strong tea. So the next morning when there were some guests, I filled a the cups with hot strong tea, almost ninetynine percent and served them. I was scolded! Actually there is no rule. He himself liked very hot, bitter tea, fiUed to the brim, but almost a the guests didn't like hot, bitter tea. For him I should serve bitter, hot tea, and for the guests I should otTer tea the usual way. He never told us anything. When I got up twenty minutes earlier than the wakeup be, I was scolded, Don't get up so early! You will disturb my sleep. Usually, if I got up earlier, it was good, but for him it was not so good. When you try to understand things better, without any rules or prejudice, this is the meaning of seAessnes.. You may say that something is a rule, but rules are already a selfish idea. Actually there are no rules, so when you say, This is the rule, you are forcing something, the rules, on others. Rules are only needed when we don't have much time, or when we cannot help others more closely in a kind way. To say, This is the rule, so you should do it' is easy, but, actually, that is not our way. For the beginner, maybe, instruction is necessary, but for advanced students we don't give much instruction, and they tryout various ways. If possible, we give instruction to people one by one. Because that is difficult, we give group instruction or a lecture like this. But don't stick to the lecture. Think about what I reaUy mean. I feel sorry that I cannot help you very much. But the way to study true Zen is not verbal. Just open yourself and give up Oeverything. Whatever happens, whether you think it is good or bad, study closely and see what you find out. This is the fundamental auilUde. Sometimes you will do things without much reason, like a child who draws pictures whether they are good or bad. If that is difficult for you, you are not actually ready to practice zazen. This is what it means to surrender, even though you have nothing to surrender. Without losing yourself by sticking to a particular rule or understanding, keep finding yourself, moment after moment. This is the only thing for you to do.Thank you very much.Be Kind with YourselfI want you to have the actual feeling of true practice, because even though I practiced zazen when I was young, I didn't know exactly what it was. Sometimes I was very impressed by our practice at Eiheiji and other monasteries. When I saw great teachers or listened to their lectures, I was deeply moved. But it was difficult to understand those experiences. Our aim is to have complete experience or full feeling in each .ment of practice. What we teach is that enlightenment and practice are one, but my practice was what we ca stepladder Zen: I understand this much now, and next year, I thought, I will understand a little bit more. That kind of practice doesn't make much senseI could never be satisfied. If you try stepladder practice, maybe you too will realize that it is a mistake. If we do not have some warm, big satisfaction in our practice, that is not true practice. Even though you sit, trying to have the right posture and counting your breath, it may still be lifeless zazen, because you are just following instructioll. You are not kind enough with yourself. You think that if you follow the instructions given by some teacher, then you will have good Ozazen, but the purpose of instruction is to encourage you to be kind with yourself. Do not count your breaths just to avoid your thinking mind but to take the best care of your breathing. If you are very kind with your breathing, one breath after another, you will have a refreshed, warm feeling in your zazen. When you have a warm feeling for your body and your breath, then you can take care of your practice, and you will be fully satisfied. When you are very kind with yourself, naturally you will feel like this. A mother will take care of her child even though she may have no idea how to make her baby happy. Similarly, when you take care of your posture and your breathing, there is a warm feeling in it. When you have a warm feeling in your practice, that is a good example of the great mercy of Buddha. Whether you are a priest or a layperson, this practice will extend to your everyday life. When you take the utmost care of what you do, then you feel good. Tozan Ryokai attained enlightenment many times. Once when he was crossing a river he saw himself reflected in the water and composed a verse, Don't try to figure out who you are. If you try to figure out who you are, what you understand will be far away from you. You will have just an image of yourself. Actually, you are in the river. You may say that is just a shadow or a reflection of yourself, but if you look carefully with warmhearted feeling, that is you. You may think you are very warmhearted, but when you try to understand how warm, you cannot actually measure. Yet when you see yourself with a warm feeling in the mirror or the water, that is actually you. And whatever you do, you are there. When you do something with a warmhearted feeling, Manjushri, the Bodhisattva of wisdom, is there, and there is the true .Fyou. You don't have to wonder where Manjushri is or what he is doing. When you do things with your warmhearted mind, that is actual practice. That is how to take care of things, that is how to communicate with people. Some of you are priests and some are not priests, and each of you will go your own way. Those of you who are not married and those of you who are married each have your own way of extending practice to your everyday lives. Although our situations are different, practice is the same, and we all meet Manjushri. Even though he is one, he is everywhere, with everyone and everything. Whatever you do, whatever your practice is, Manjushri is there. The secret is not to forget the true mercy of Buddha who takes care of everything. If we lose this point, whatever we do doesn't make sense. So we put emphasis on warm heart, warm zazen. The warm feeling we have in our practice is, in other words, enlightenment, or Buddha's mercy, Buddha's mind. It is not a matter of just counting your breath or following your breath. If counting the breath is tedious, it may be better just to foUow the breath. But the point is, while inhaling and exhaling, to take care of the breath, just as a mother watches her baby. If a baby smiles, its mother will smile. If a baby cries, its mother is worried. That kind of close relationship, being one with your practice, is the point. I am not talking about anything new the same old things! Our monastic rules are based on kind, warmhearted mind. The idea is not to restrict your freedom, but rather to give you freedom to behave and act in your own way. It is not so important to foUow the rules literally. Actually, if you break a rule now and then, we will know what is wrong with you, and your teacher, without criticizing you, may be able to help you more Oaccurately. This is how to improve your practice in order to have good control over your desires and your everyday life. Then you will have big freedom from everything. That is the goal of our practice both for priests and for laypeople.Please take care of your practice.He very kind with yourself.Thank you very much.Respect for ThingsIn our zazen practice we stop our thinking, and we are free from our emotional activity. We don't say there is no emotional activity, but we are free from it. We don't say we have no thinking, but our life activity is not limited by our thinking mind. In short, we can say that we trust ourselves completely, without thinking, without feeling, without discriminating berween good and bad, right and wrong. Because we respect ourselves, because we put faith in our life, we sit. That is our practice. When our life is based on respect and complete trust, it will be completely peaceful. Our relationship with nature should also be like this. We should respect everything, and we can practice respecting things in the way we relate with them. This morning when we were bowing in the zen do, we heard a big noise overhead because upstairs in the dining room people were pushing chairs across the tile floor without picking them up. This is not the way to treat chairs, not only because it may disturb the people who are bowing in the zendo underneath, but also because fundamentally this is not a respectful way to treat things. To push the chairs across the floor is very convenient, but it will give us a lazy feeling. Of course this kind of laziness is pa Hz.Oof our culture, and it eventually causes us to fight with each other. Instead of respecting things, we want to use them for ourselves, and if it is difficult to use them, we want to conquer them. This kind of idea does not accord with the spirit of practice. In the same way my teacher Kishizawa Ian did not allow us to put away the amado more than one at a time. Do you know the amado They are the wooden doors outside of shoji screens, which are put up to protect the shoji from storms. At the end of the building there is a big box for storing the amado. Since they are sliding doors, one priest can easily push five or six doors, and another priest can wait and put them in the box. But my teacher didn't like this. He told us to move them one by one. So we would slide each door and put it in the box, one door at a time. When we pick up the chairs one by one carefully, without making much noise, then we will have the feeling of practice in the dining room. We will not make much noise of course, but also the feeling is quite different. When we practice this way we ourselves are Buddha, and we respect ourselves. To care for the chairs means our practice goes beyond the zendo. If we think it is easy to practice because we have a beautiful building, that is a mistake. Actually it may be quite difficult to practice with a strong spirit in this kind of settingwhere we have a handsome Buddha and offer beautiful Howers to decorate our Buddha hall. We Zen Buddhists have a saying that with a blade of grass we create a golden Buddha which is sixteen feet high. That is our spirit, so we need to practice respect for things. I don't mean that we should accumulate many leaves or grasses to make a big statue, but until we can see a big Buddha in a small leaf, we need to make much more effort. How much effort I don't know. Some people may find it quite easy, but for someone like me great effort is needed. Although seeing a large golden Buddha in a large golden Buddha is easier, when you see a large TrRfiliBuddha in a blade of grass, your joy will be something special. So we need to practice respect with great effort. In this zendo everyone can come and practice our way, experienced students and also those who don't know anything about Zen. Both will have difficulties. New students will have difficulties that they could never have imagined. Old students have a double duty to do their own practice and to encourage those who have just come. Without telling them, you should do this or you shouldn't do that, the old students should lead the new students so that they can practice our way more easily. Even though newer students don't know what Buddhism is, they will naturally have a good feeling when they come to a beautiful Buddha hall. That is the ornament of a Buddha land, but for Zen Buddhists especially, the true ornament of the Buddha hall is the people who arc practicing there. Each one of us should be a beautiful flower and each one of us should be Buddha,leading people in our practice. Whatever we do, we are considering how to do this. Since there are no special rules for how to treat things or how to be friendly with others, we keep studying what will help people practice together. If you don't forget this point you will find out how to treat people, how to treat things, and how to treat yourself. This is what we call the Bodhisattva way. Our practice is to help people, and to help people we find out how to practice our way on each moment. To stop our thinking and to be free from emotional activity when we sit is not just a matter of concentration. This is to rely completely on ourselves, to find absolute refuge in our practice. We are just like a baby who is in the lap of its mother. I think we have a very good spirit here in this zendo. I am rather amazed at the spirit, but the next question is how to extend this spirit to your everyday life. You do it by respecting things Oand respecting each other, because when we respect things we will find their true life. When we respect plants we will find their real life, the power and beauty of Rowers. Though love is important, if it is separated from respect and sincerity, it will not work. With big mind and with pure sincerity and respect, love can really be love. So let's try hard and find out how to make a blade of grass into a big Buddha.Thank you very much.Observing the PreceptsIn the full lotus position we cross the right leg over the left and the left leg over the right. SymbolicaUy, the right is activity and the left is the opposite, calmness of mind. If the left is wisdom, the right is practice and when we cross our legs, we don't know which is which. So even though we have two, symbolicaUy we have oneness. Our posture is vertical without leaning right or left, backward or forward. This is an expression of perfect understanding of the teaching that is beyond duality. When we extend this, we naturally have precepts and the study of how to observe our precepts. This posture of zazen is not just a kind of training, but is the actual way of transmitting Buddha's teaching to us. Word. by themselves are not good enough to actualize his teaching, so it is transmitted through activity or through human relationship. In addition to precepts we have the relationship between teacher and disciple. The disciple must choose the teacher, and then the teacher will accept the disciple, although sometimes a teacher may recommend another teacher. Between teachers there should not be any conAict, so if a teacher thinks another is more qualified, he may recommend him or her. Once you become a disciple, devote youtSeif to studying the Way. At first as a disciple you may wish to practice with a teacher not because you want to study Buddhism but for some other reason. Still it doesn't maUer, you know. If you devote youtSelf completely to your teacher, you will undetStand. You will be your teacher's disciple, and you can tr.nsnut our way. This relationship between teacher and disciple is very important, and at the same time it is difficult for both teacher and disciple to be teacher and disciple in its true sense, so they should both make their best effort. Teacher and disciple practice various rituals together. Rituals are more than just tr.ining. Through rituals we communicate and tr.nsnut the teaching in a true sense. We put emphasis on selflessness. When we practice together, we orget our own pr.Ctice. It is each individual's practice, yet it is also othet' practice. For instance, when we practice chanting, we ., Recite the sutr. with your eat. Then with our eat we listen to othet, while with our mouths we practice our own practice. Here we have complete egolessness in its true sense. Egolessness does not mean to give up your own individual practice. True egolessness has forgotten egoles.nes.. As long as you believe, My practice is egoless' that means you stick to ego, because you stick to giving up egocentered practice. When you practice your own practice together with othct, then true egolessness happens. That egolessness is not just egolessness. It also includes ego practice, but at the same time it is the practice of egolessness that is beyond ego or egolessness. Do you understand This is also true in the observation of precepts. If you try to observe the precepts, that is not true observation of precepts. When you observe the precepl without trying to observe the precepts, that is true observation of the precepts. Our inmost :TilSnature can help us. When we understand the precepts as an expression of our inmost nature, that is the Way as is. Then there are no precepts. When we are expressing our inmost nature, no precepts are necessary, so we are not observing any precepts. On the other hand we have the opposite nature, so we want to observe our precept. We feel that the necessity of observing the precepts will help us, and when we understand the precepts in this negative or prohibitory sense that is also the blossoming of our true nature. So we have a choice of how to observe precepts, one negative and the other positive. Also, when we do not feel that we can observe all the precepts, then we can choose the ones that we feel we can work with. Precepts are not rules set up by someone. Since our life is the expression of our true nature, if something is wrong with that expression, then Buddha will say that is not the way. Then you will have precepts. The actual event or fact is first, not the rules. So it is the nature of precepts that we have a chance to choose our precepts. If you go one way, you will have these precepts and if you take another way, you will have some other precepts. Whether you go this way or that way is up to you. Either way you will have some precepts. At first you should depend on your teacher. This is the best way, and you begin by following the prohibitory precepts. When you become familiar with our way, you will have a more positive observation of the precepts. How a teacher points out the student's mistake is very important. If a teacher thinks that what his student did is a mistake, he is not a true teacher. It may be a mistake, but on the other hand it is an expression of the student's true nature. When we understand this, we have respect for our student's true nature, and we will be careful how we point out mistakes. In the scriptures five point are made about how to be careful. One is that the teacher has to choose his opportunity and nC Opoint out t.le student's mistake in hont of many people. If possible the teacher points out the mistake personally in an appropriate time and place. Secondly the teacher is reminded to be truthful, which means the teacher does not point o his disciple's mistake just because he thinks it is a mistake. Wl.n the teacher understands why the disciple did so, then he can I truthful. The third reminder is for the teacher to be gIltlc and cahn, and speak in a low voice rather than shouting. This is somcthing very delicate like truthfulness, but here the scripture p cmphasis on having a calm gende attitude when talking about somcone's mistake. The fourth one is that the teacher gives advice or points out the disciple' mistake solely for the sake of helping him, and docs not do this just to get something off his chest. Hcrc the tcacher is very careful, noticing when the student is making some excuse for what he did, or when the student is not serious enough. Then the teacher should ignore him until he becomcs more serious. Even thoWh we give advice only for the sake of helping the student, still this does. not mean to always be easy with the student. Sometimes we should be very tough with the student, or we cannot help in a true sense. The last one is to point out the student's mistake with compassion, which means that the teacher is not just the tcacher but also the disciple's friend. a friend the teacher points I some problem or gives some advice. So it is not easy to be a teacher or to be a student, and we cannot n:Iy on anything, even the precepts. We have to make our utmost dfort to help each other. And we do not observc our precepts just for the sake of precepts or practice rituals for the perfection of rituals. We are studying how to express our true nature.i'hank you very much.Pure Silk, Sharp IronLast week one of the Sunday School children saw me sitting zazen, and she said, I can do it. She crossed her legs and said, Now what Now what I was very interested in her question because many of you have the same question. You come here every day to practice Zen, and you ask me, Now what Now what I don't think I can fully explain this point. It is not a question that can be answered. You should know for yourself. We sit in a formal posture so we can experience something through our bodies, not by my teaching, but by your own physical practice. However, to be able to sit in a particular way and to attain a particular state of mind is not perfect study. After you have full experience of mind and body, you will be able to express it in other ways as well. Without sticking to a formal posture, you naturally convey your mind to others in various ways. You will have the same state of mind sitting in a chair or standing, working or speaking. It is the state of mind in which you do not stick to anything. This is the purpose of our practice. . so Yesterday a Japanese visitor was speaking about Japanese literature. Japanese people have been studying Chinese characters and Chinese culture since about or .., and after using Chinese characters they established their own way of writing. The same thing will happen here with our practice. One hundred years after the Japanese government stopped sending students to China to study Chinese culture, we had an exquisite Japanese culture. In the Fujiwara period especiaUy, we had beautiful Japanese literature and calligraphy. There was a lot of freedom. Artists and scholars studied the arts, philosophy, and religion. They tried various disciplines, and they had good teachers. The work that followed the Fujiwara period was not so good. According to my visitor some of the later calligraphy was too formal and shows too much of the artist's ego. We cannot see any personality in their calligraphy. The personality we sec in art should be well trained without much ego in it. I think you can understand the difference between personality' and ego. Ego is something that covers your good personality. Everyone has character, but if you don't train yourself, your character is covered by ego. You cannot appreciate your personality. Through long practice and training, we get rid of ego. A word in Japanese that expresses this training is lCn. Nenl is how we refine silk by washing it many times so that the thread are white and soft enough to weave. We also use the character for iron. We temper iron by hitting it while it is hotnot to forge or to shape it but to make it strong. Hitting it after it is cold doesn't work. Training is something like this. When you are young, you have a lot of ego, a lot of desires. Through training you rub and wash your ego, and you become quite soft, like pure white silk. Even though you have strong desires, if you temper them enough, you will have strong sharp iron, like a Japanese sword. This is how we train ourselves. Rl, This is not something for me to talk about, but something I must show you by my everyday life, which is not so good. I am afraid you will study only my weak points. We should know why we practice zazen, and we should be able to te the difference between something that is good and something that just looks good. There is a big difference. Unless you train yourself through hard practice, you will have no eyes to see and no feeling to appreciate something that is truly good. Only when many people have the eyes to see or to feel something good will we have good teachers and students. This is mutual practice. Buddha was great because people were great. When people are not ready, there will be no Buddha. I don't expect everyone of you to be a great teacher, but we must have eyes to see what is good and what is not so good. This mind will be acquired by practice. Even in the Fujiwara period, Chinese culture and calligraphy were far superior to Japanese. The Chinese people had various brushes and alvays used the brush more than the Japanese people did. The Japanese had fewer materials to make brushes. We had lots of bamboo but few sheep or animals from which to make brushes. So our training in calligraphy was more limited than that of Chinese peoples. But even before Japanese people mastered Chinese calligraphy completely, they had already started a unique Japanese calligraphy. I find this very interesting. HistoricaUy Buddhists have been very sincere about this point. That is why we have Dharma transmission. Chinese masters especiaUy put strong emphasis on transmission. It is necessary to master the teacher's way completely, before you are free from it. That is very hard practice. That is why it takes such a long time to be a Zen master. It is not knowledge it is not some power. The point is whether a person is trained enough to be like pure white silk and very sharp iron. At that time, without trying to do A ,Oanything, you will be able to express your personaliry in its true sense. If we cannot see any true personaliry in a person's work, it means that he has not yet eliminated his habitual way. My own habit is absentmindedness. I am naturally very forgetful. Even though I started working on it when I went to my teacher at the age of thirteen, I have not been able to do anything about it. I is not because of old age that I am forgetful it is my tendency. ! working on it, I found that I could get rid of my selfish way of doing things. If the purpose of practice and training was just to correct your weak points, I think it would be almost impossible to succeed. Even so, it is necessary to work on them, because as you work on them, your character will be trained, and you will become free of ego. People say I am very patient, but actually I have a very impatient character. My inborn character is very impatielll. I don't try to correct it any longer, but I don't think my eTort was in vain, because I studied many things. I had to be very patient in order to work on my habit, and I must be very patient when people criticize me about my forgetfulness. Oh, he is so forgetful, we cannot rely on him at all. What should we do with him My teacher scolded me every day: This forgetful boy! But I just wanted stay with him. I didn't want to leave him. I was very patient with whatever he said. So I think that is why I am very patient with others' criticism about me. Whatever they say, I don't mind so much. I am not so angry with them. If you know how important it is to train yourself in this way, I think you will understand what Buddhism is. This is the most important point in our practice.Thank you very much.Not Always SoIn Buddhist scripture there is a famous pas.Qge that explains that water is not just water. For human beings water is water, but for celestial beings it is a jewel. For fish it is their home, and for people in he or hungry ghosts it is blood, or maybe fire. If they want to drink it, water changes into fire, and they cannot drink it. The same water looks very different to various beings. Most people think that water is water is the right understanding, and that it should not be a home or a jewel, blood or fire. Water should be water. But Dogen Zenji says: Even though you say 'water is water,' it is not quite right. When we practice zazen, we may think, This is the right practice, and we will attain something correct and perfect. But if you ask Dogen Zenji, he may say, Not quite right. This point is a good koan for you to study. When we say, Water is water, we understand things materiaUy. We say that water is Hl, but under some conditions Hl may be ice or mist, or it may be vapor or a human body. It is only water under some circumstances. For convenience, we may tentatively say that water is water, but we should appreciate water in its true sense. Water is more than just water. When I am drinking water, water is everything. The whole world is water. Nothing exists besides water. When we drink water with this understanding and attitude, that is water, and at the same time it is more than water. When we just sit in meditation, we include everything. There is nothing else, nothing but you. That is shikantza. We become completely ourselves. We have everything, and we are fully satisfied. There is nothing to attain, so we have a sense of gratitude or joyful mind. I think I understand why you practice zazen. Most of you are seeking something. You seek what is true and real, because you have heard so many things that you cannot believe in. You are not even seeking for what is beautiful, because you have found that something which looks beautiful may not actually be beautiful. It is just the surface of something or just an ornament. You are also aware of how people can be hypocritical. Many people who appear to be virtuous don't convey real gratitude or joyful mind, so you don't trust them. You don't know whom to trust or what teaching to believe, so you come here looking for something. I cannot give you what you are seeking, because I myself don't believe in any particular thing. I don't say that water is water, or that water is a jewel or a house, fire or blood. As Dogen Zenji said, water is more than that. We may want to stick to righteousness, beauty, truth, or virtue, but it is not wise to seek for something like that. There is something more. I have noticed that you like to travel. Today Alaska, the next day India and Tibet. You are seeking for something, whether it is a fire or a jewel, or something else. When you realize it is not always so, you cannot believe in those things anymore, and your Oway of seeking the truth will change. Otherwise you will be sticking to something. To seek for a great teaching like Buddhism is to seek for something good. Whatever you find, you will be like a sightseer. Even though you don't travel in your car, spiritually you are sightseeing: Oh, what a beautiful teaching. This is a really true teaching! To be a sightseer is one of the dangers of Zen practice. Be careful! To be captivated by the teaching doesn't help at a. Don't be fooled by things, whether it is something beautiful or something that looks true. This is just playing games. You should trust Buddha, trust the Dharma, and trust the Sangha in its true sense. Real freedom is to not feel limited when wearing this Zen robe, this troublesome formal robe. Similarly in our busy life we should wear this civilization without being bothered by it, without ignoring it, without being caught by it. Without going anywhere, without escaping it, we can find composure in this busy life. Dogen Zenji says to be like a boatman. Although he is carried by the boat, he is also handling the boat. That is how we live in this world. Even though you understand how to live in this world like a boatman, that does not mean you are able to do it. It is very difficult, which is why you practice zazen. Yesterday I said, However painful your legs are, you shouldn't move, and some people may have understood what I said literally. What I was reaUy saying is that your determination to practice zazen should be like that. If it is too painful, you can change your posture, but your determination should be like that. And should be is also a good example. It is not necessarily so. The secret of Soto Zen is just two words: Not always so. Oopsthree words in English. In Japanese, two words. Not always so. This is the secret of the teaching. It may be so, but it Ois not always so. Without being caught by words or rules, withI t many preconceived ideas, we actually do something, and doing something, we apply our teaching. To stick to something rigidly is laziness. Before you do something difficult, you want to undersland it, so you are caught by words. When you are brave enough to accept your surroundings without saying what is right and what is wrong, then the teaching that was told to you will help. If you are caught by the teaching, you will have a double problem whether you should follow the teaching or go your own way. This problem is created by grasping the teaching. So practice first, and then apply the teaching. We practice zazen like someone close to dying. There is nothing to rely on, nothing to depend on. Because you are dying, you don't wan! anything, so you cannot be fooled by anything. Most people are not only fooled by something, they are also fooled by themselves, by their ability, their beauty, their confidence, or their outlook. We should know whether or not we are fooling ourselves. When you are fooled by something else, the damage will not be so big, but when you are fooled by yourself, it is fatal. You may feel some resistance to this Zen way of life or to your life in the world, but don't be lost in resistance. Do you understand If you are deeply involved in resistance or fight, you will lose yourself. You will lose your strength, lose your friends and your parents. You will lose everything, your confidence, the brightness of your eyes. You are a dead body! And no one will say: Oh, I am sorry. No one will say so. Look at your face in the mirror to see if you are still alive or not. Even though you practice zazen, if you don't stop being fooled, it won't help at a. Do you understandLet's practice hard, while we are still a little bit alive.Thank you very much.Direct Experience of RealityZen Master Dogen said: Mountains and rivers, earth and skyeverything is encouraging us to attain enlightenment. In the same way the purpose of my lecture is to encourage you to attain enlightenment. to have a real experience of Buddhism. Even though you think you are studying Buddhism when you are reading. you may have St an inteUectual understanding rather than a direct experience. Intellectual understanding is necessary. but it will not complete your study. This does not mean to ignore intellectual understanding. or that enlightenment is entirely different from intellectual understanding. The true. direct experience of things can be intellectualized. and this conceptual explanation may help you have direct experience. Both intellectual understanding and direct experience are necessary. but it is important to know the difference. Sometimes you may think something is an enlightenment experience. and it isjust intellectual. That is why you must have a true teacher who knows the difference. So when we study Buddhism, it is necessary to have strong conviction, and to study not only with our mind but also with our body. If you come to the lecture even though you are sleepy and unable to listen to it, your attending the lecture will bring you some experience of enlightenment. It will be enlightenment itself. Direct experience will come when you are completely one with your activiry when you have no idea of self. This could be when you are sitting, but it could also be whenever your wayseeking mind is strong enough to forget your selfish desires. When you believe you have some problem it means your practice is not good enough. When your practice is good enough, whatever you see, whatever you do, that is the direct experience of realiry. This point should be remembered. Usually, without knowing this point we are involved in judgments, so we say, this is right, that is wrong, this is perfect, and that is not perfect. That seems ridiculous when we are doing real practice. Sometimes we may say that for Duddhists there is nothing wrong. Whatever you do, you know, Buddha is doing it, not me, or, Buddha is responsible, not me. Dut if you use that as an excuse, that is a misunderstanding. We say, All beings have Buddha Nature to encourage you to have an actual experience of it. The purpose of the statement isjust to encourage your true practice, not to give you some excuse for your lazy practice or your practice that is merely formal. In China people would carry something on their heads, perhaps honey or water in big jars. Sometimes someone must have dropped the jar. This is a big mistake, of course, but if you do not look back, it is a right. You just go on and on, even though there is no more honey or water on your head. If you go on and on, that is not a mistake. But if you say, Oh! I lost it! Oh my! that is a mistake. That is not true practice. ExrRlroNc o RroLlY When a skillful martial artist uses his sword, he should be able to cut a fly of his friend's nose without cutting his nose. To have the fear of cutting his nose is not true practice. When you do something, have a strong determination to do it! Wl! Sound of sword cutting air. Withom any idea of skillful or not, dangerous or not, you just do it. When you do something with this kind of conviction, that is true practice. That is true enlightenment. This strong conviction to realize your life is beyond successful or not successful. Beyond any feeling of fear, you just do it. That is real practice and that is the wayseeking mind, which goes beyond the dualistic idea of good and bad, right or wrong. You just do it. That is how we practice the Four Vows. We help people just because we wish to, not because we think we will be successful. Sentient beings are numberless, so we don't know if we can completely help a sentient beings. Yet it doesn't matter. As long as we are here, we should continue our practice of helping beings. There is no limit to our understanding of the teaching. Whether we understand it or not, we go on trying to understand. When we study with this kind of conviction, we will meet with valuable teachings, rarely encountered even in a thousand kalpas. This absolute teaching is incomparable to any other teaching. An incomparable teaching does not mean it is the best teaching. As Dogen Zenji says, We do not discuss the meaning of the teaching in a comparative way but emphasize how to practice. We focus our study on how to accept the teaching and live the teaching. Whether or not our teaching is profound or lofty misses the point, which is to develop our attitude of study. This is characteristic of Zen and characteristic of true Buddhism. Rather than setting up a system of Buddhism, we put emphasis on true practice. . All the rules we have are just to make practice easier. Not to make our door narrow but to open our door to everyone. We know how difficult it is, so we set up some rules to help you practice. If there is no pole for you to climb up, it is difficult for you to experience the kind of feeling you will have when you jump off the top. If a baby has no toy, it is rather difficult to have the actual experience of a human being. The rules we have are a kind of toy to help your experience as a Buddhist. It does not mean that the toy is always necessary, but when you are young it is necessary. So it is not necessary to always stick to the rules. What is important is to extend your way of life deeper and wider. To have a beautiful ceramic bowl is not necessary when you are ready to appreciate things. Whatever it is, things will encourage your practice. If you can enjoy your life in its true sense, then even if you injure your body, it is a right. Even if you die, it is a right. When you are encouraged by everything, and you realize everything is always helping you, then there is no difference whether you are dead or alive. It is a right. Quite all right. That is complete renunciation. Your practice will be vigorous enough to continue forever, regardless of life or death. In this way, our enlightenment can be explained. How to practice in his way is up to you. I cannot explain your understanding of Buddhism. You should explain your way of life as a Buddhist in your own way. My talk is just to encourage your practice. You cannot foUow it exactly, bur maybe it will give you some suggestion.Thank you very much.True ConcentrationTrue concentration does not mean to be concentrated on only one thing. Although we say, do things one by one, what it means is difficult to explain. Without trying to concentrate our mind on anything, we are ready to concentrate on something. For instance. if my eyes are on one person in the zendo. it will be impossible to give my anention to others. So when I practice zazen, 'm not watching anybody. Then, if anyone moves, I can spot them. Avalokiteshvara is the Bodhisanva of compassion. Sometimes portrayed as a man, Avalokiteshvara also appears in the form of a woman. Sometimes she has one thousand hands to help others, but if she concentrates on only one hand. then hands will be of no use. From ancient times the main point of practice has been to have a clear. calm mindwhatever you do. Even when you eat something good, your mind should be calm enough to appreciate the labor of preparing the food and the effort of making the dishes, chopsticks, bowls, and everything we use. With a serene mind we .wOcan appreciate the flavor of each vegetable, one by one. We don't add much seasoning, so we can enjoy the virtue of each vegetable. That is how we cook and how we eat food. To know someone is to sense that person's Ravorwhat you feel from that person. Each one has his or her own flavor, a particular personality from which many feelings appear. To fully appreciate this personality or flavor is to have a good relationship. Then we can really be friendly. To be friendly does not mean to cling to someone or try to please them bill to fully appreciate them. To appreciate things and people, our mind need to be calm and clear. So we practice zazen or just sitting without any gaining idea. At this time you are you yourself. You setde yourself on yourself. Wilh this practice we have freedom, but it may be that the freedom you mean and the freedom Zen Buddhists mean are not the same. To altain freedom, we cross our legs, keep our posture upright, and let our eyes and ears be open to everything. This readiness or openness is important because we are liable to go to extremes and stick to something. In this way we may lose our calmness or mirrorlike mind. Zazen practice is how we obtain calmness and clarity of mind, bill we cannot do this by physically forcing something on ourselves or by creating some special state of mind. You may think that to have a mirrorlike mind is Zen practice. It is so, bill if you practice zazen in order to altain that kind of mirrorlike mind,that is not the practice we mean. It has instead become the art of Zen. The difference between the art of Zen and true Zen is that already you have true Zen without trying. When you try to do something, you lose it. You are concentrating on one hand out of one thousand hands. You lose hands. That is why we say, ''Just sit. It does not mean to stop your mind altogether or to be NlSconcentrated completely on your breathing, although these are a help. You may become bored when you practice counting the breath because it does not mean much to you, but then you have lost your understanding of real practice. We practice concentration or let our mind follow our breathing so that we are not involved in some complicated practice in which we lose ourselves, attempting to accomplish something. In the art of Zen you try to be like a skiUful Zen master who has great strength and good practice: Oh, I want to be like him. I must try hard. The art of Zen is concerned with how to draw a straight line or how to control your mind. But Zen is for everyone, even if you cannot draw a straight line. If you can draw a line,just draw a line, that is Zen. For a child this is natural, and even though the line is not straight, it is beautiful. So whether or not you like the crosslegged position, or whether or not you think you can do it, if you know what zazen really is, you can do it. The most important thing in our practice is just to follow our schedule and to do things with people. You may say this is group practice, but it is not so. Group practice is quite different, another kind of art. During the war some young people, encouraged by the militaristic mood of Japan, recited to me this line from the Slmslog: To understand birth and death is the main point of practice. They said, Even though I don't know anything about that sutra, I can die easily at the front. That is group practice. Encouraged by trumpets, guns, and war cries, it is quite easy to die. That kind of practice is not our practice either. Although we practice with people, our goal is to practice with mountains and rivers, with trees and stones, with everything in the world, everything in the universe, and to find ourselves in this big cosmos. When we practice in this big world we know intuitively which Ssoway to go. When your surroundings give you a sib' showing which way to go, even though you have no idea of following a sign, you will go in the right direction. To practice our way is good, but you may be practicing with a mistaken idea. Still if you know, I am making a mistake, but even so I cannot help continuing with my practice, then there is no need to worry. If you open your lfue eyes, and accept the you that is involved in a wrong idea of practice, that is real practice. You accept your thinking because it is already there. You cannot do anything about it. There is no need to try to get rid of it. This is not a mailer of right or wrong, but of how to accept frankly, with openness of mind, what you are doing. That is the most important point. When you practice zazen you will accept the you who is thinking about something, without trying to be free of the images you have. Oh! Here they come. If someone is moving over there, Oh, he is moving. And if he stops moving, your eyes remain the same. That is how your eyes will see when you are not watching anything special. In that way your practice includes everything, one thing after another, and you do not lose your calmness of mind. The extent of this practice is limitless. With this as our base, we have real freedom. When you evaluate yourself as being good or bad, right or wrong, that is comparative value, and you lose your absolute value. When you evaluate yourself by a limitless measure, each one of you will be settled on your real self. That is enough, even though you think you need a beller measurement. If you understand this point, you will know what real practice is for human beings and for everything.Thank you very much.Wherever I Go, I Meet MyselfMost of us want to know what the self is. This is a big problem. I am trying to understand why you have this problem. It seems to me that even though you try to understand who you are, it is an endles. task, and you will never see your self. You say that to sit without thinking is difficult, but it will be even more difficult to try to think about your self. To reach a conclusion is almost impossible, and if you continue trying, you become crazy, and you won't know what to do with your self. Your culture is based on ideas of selfimprovement. The idea of improvement is rather scientific. In the scientific sense, improvement means that instead of going to Japan by ship, now you can go by jumbo jet. So improvement is based on comparative value, which is also the basis of our society and our economy. I understand that you are rejecting that idea of civilization, but you are not rejecting the idea of improvement. You still try to improve something. Perhaps most of you sit to improve your zazen, but Buddhists do not hold so strongly to the idea of improvement. lo. When you practice zazen trying to improve yourself, you may want to know yourself in a more psychological way. Psychology will te you about certain aspects of yourself, but it will not tell you exactly who you are. It is just one of many interpretations of your mind. If you go to a psychologist or psychiatrist, you will endlessly have new information about yourself. As long as you are going, you may feel some relief. You may feel released from the burden you carry, but in Zen we understand ourselves quite differently. Tozan, the founder of the Chinese Soto Zen School, said, Don't try to see yourself objectively. In other words, don't try to seek for information about yourself that is the objective truth. That is information. He says that the real you is quite different from any information you have. The real you is not that kind of thing. I go my own way. Wherever I go, I meet myself. Tozan rejects your effort to cling to information about yourself, and says to go on alone using your own legs. Whatever people may say, you should go your own way, and at the same time you should practice with people. This is another point. It means that to meet yourself is to practice with people. When you see someone practicing sincerely, you see yourself. If you are impressed by someone's practice, you may say, Oh, she is doing very we. That she is neither she nor youshe is something more than that. What is she After thinking for a while, you may say, Oh, she is there and I am here. But when you were struck by her practice, that her is neither you nor her. When you are struck by something, that is actually the real you. Tentatively I say you, but that you is the pure experience of our practice. As long as you are trying to improve yourself, you have a core idea of self, which is wrong practice. That is not the practice we mean.When you empry your mind, when you give up everythingHro.,MroErFand just practice zazen with an open mind, then whatever you see you meet yourself. That is you, beyond she or he or me. As long as you are clinging to the idea of self and trying to improve your practice or discover something, trying to create an improved, better self, then your practice has gone astray. You have no time to reach the goal, so eventually you will get tired out, and you will say, Zen is no good. practiced zazen for ten years, but I didn't gain anything! But if you just come here and sit with sincere students and find yourself among them. and you continue in that way. that is our practice. You can have this kind of experience wherever you are. As Tozan said. Wherever I go, I meet myself. If he sees water, that is to see hin.clf. To see water is enough for him. even though he cannot see himself in the water. So the way to understand yourself is not by understanding yourself objectively or gathering information from various sources. If people say you are crazyOkay. I am crazy! If people say you are a bad student. it may be so. I am a bad student. but I am trying pretty hard. That is enough. When you sit in that way. you accept yourself and accept everything together with yourself. When you are involved in various silly problems. you sit with the problems you have. That is you at that time. When you try to get out of your problems. that is already wrong practice. If you cling to an idea you create. like a self or an objective reality. you will be lost in the objective world that you create with your mind. You are creating things one after another, so there is no end. There may be various worlds you are creating. and to create and see many things is very interesting. but you should not be lost in your creations. The other side of our practice is that we think and we act. We do not try to be like a stone. Everyday life is our practice. Instead of being enslaved by the thinking mind or the imagina Otion or emotional activity, we just think in its true sense. Thinking comes to us from our true self, which includes everything. Before we think about it, trees, birds, and everything are thinking. And when they think, they groan or they sing. That is their thinking. There is no need for us to think more than that. If we see trIgs as s, thinking is already there. This kind of pure thinking is the thinking we have in our practice, so we always have freedom from ourselves too. We can see tll as s, and at the same time we can think about things. Because we do not cling to any particular standard for thinking, for us there is no true way and no false way.Thank you very much.The Boss of EverythingThe reason we practice zazen is to be the bos.. of everything. Wherever we are. But if I say so, it will create a misunderstanding: that you are the boss of everyone or everything. When you understand in that way, you exist as an idea in your mind. That is not the you we mean. That is a delusion because the ideas you have are not well supported by your practice, and you become enslaved by the idea of you and others. When the real power of practice is supporting your understanding, then the you who is practicing our way is the boss of everything, the bos.. of you yourself. That is why Buddha said to control yourself. The self you have to control is the deluded you, not the real you. You have an idea of who you are, and you are caught by it. You are enslaved by the deluded you, so you have difficulty or confusion. When these ideas are well controlled by the power of your practice, then that you is the boss or everything. Then even a confused mind will be supported by your practice.Sounds come to your ears when you are practicing zazen.YouOmay hear various voices, and sometimes you may have various ideas in your mind, but if your practice is good, your practice owns or includes the things you hear and the images you have. They are a part of you. Your practice is strong enough to have them, to own them without being enslaved by them, as you have your own hands and eyes. Sometimes it looks like the left hand and the right hand are not cooperating when you are holding something, but they are trying to do something. When you are really the boss of everything, even though it looks like confusion, it is not confusion. t may look like you are doing something wrong, and people may say, Oh, he is doing something wrong, but that is their understanding. You are not doing anything wrong because you own everything, and you are managing things as you manage your own hands. You are letting yourself be with everything and letting things be as they want to be. That is the power of practice, and that is quite different from doing something wrong. Someone doing something wrong may suffer, but for you there is no suffering. You are just managing things in some way, as your own. The precepts also should be observed in this way. You observe precepts not because you have to follow Buddha's words, but to extend true practice into your everyday life or to settle yourself on yourself. That self includes everything. Sometimes we say that to extend your practice into everyday life is to be completely involved in your activity, or to be one with things, but that is not so clear. Then you may say that being caught up with baseball mania or infatuated with gambling is the same as practice, but that is not practice, because you are enslaved by it. You are not the boss of gamblinggambling is the boss of you. Your practice is not working. You are enslaved by something which you create in your mind. Of Your mind whirls on and creates some delusion. You have a gaining idea or a playful speculative idea, that's all. So you are enslaved by yourself and by gambling. You are not practicing zazen at all. You are not the boss, you do not own your mind, and you do not even own your legs, because as soon as you get up, your legs want to go to Reno! Your practice does not support your legs. That is the difference. So to be one with something does not mean to be caught by it. You are caught when you become a member of something in your mind. You create something interesting in your mind, you become very suggestible and feel the zeal to be a member of the group you have in your mind. You are enslaved by it, even though you have nothing besides what you created in your mind. There is no practice nothing which is supporting you. You are not the boss, and you even lose yourself. That is the difference. So we say to practice zazen without any gaining idea, without any purpose. Let things work as they do, supporting everything as your own. Real practice has orientation or direction, but it has no purpose or gaining idea, so it can include everything that comes. Whether it is good or bad doesn't matter. If something bad comes: Okay, you are a part of me and if something good comes: Oh, okay. Because we do not have any special goal or purpose of practice, it doesn't matter what comes. Since it includes everything, we call it big mind. Whatever it is, it is included within us, and we own it, so we ca it big mind or purposeles. purpose or tongueless tongue. Even though I talk about something, there is no purpose. I am talking to myself because you are a part of me, so I have no purpose in my talk. Something is going, that is all. It goes because of the real joy of sharing your practice with everything. When you practice zazen, everything practices zazen, everything you have is practicing zazen. Buddha practices zazen, Bod Ohidharma practices zazen, and everything practices zazen with you. And you share the practice with everything. Zazen happens in that way, our real life happens in that way, our real Bodhisattva way happens in that way. That is how you help others. To help others means to share your practice with people. We share our practice with children and with people on the street. Even though they do not practice zazen, we can share the practice, because if I see people, they are already here, and I practice zazen with them, with the sound of the car, with everything. If someone asks me why I practice, I may answer that it is to have a weUoriented mind. The point is not to lose this welloriented mind. In Japan children have a Bodhidharma toy. Do you know the toy It is made of paper, and even though you push it down, it will stand back up. That is weUoriented practice. People enjoy tossing the toy around, because wherever it goes, it will stand back up. That is a good example of our practice. We cannot find where the self is. If you say, Here is my mind, that is already an idea of self. It is here instead of there. You think your mind is in your head, but where is it No one knows. So our practice is to be with everything. Without being enslaved by it, you are able to share your practice with everything. That is how to establish yourself on yourself. You are ready to include everything. When you include everything, that is the real self.Thank you very much.Sincere PracticeAlthough Dogen Zenji is considered to be the founder of the Soto Zen school in Japan, he didn't like to identify himself as Zen, let alone Sow. If necessary, he said to ca us Buddha's disciples, and he called himself Monk Dogen. When Dogen Zenji studied in China with the Zen master Tendo Nyojo Zenji, there were various schools of Zen like Rinzai, Sow, Ummon, Hogen, and Igyo. According to Dogen though, Nyojo Zenji did not belong to any particular school. His Zen wasjust to practice zazen and to realize Buddha's spirit with his own body and mind. That was why Dogen accepted him as his teacher. In Japan Dogen had studied Tendai Buddhism and later went Eisai Zenji's temple to study Rinzai. But Eisai died shortly after, and Dogen wanted to continue his practice with the right teacher, so he went to China with Myozen, who was one of Eisai's disciples. Although he visited many temples and saw many Zen teachers, he couldn't accept anyone as his teacher until he met Nyojo Zenji. When Dogen Zenji saw Nyojo ZelUi for the first time, even without studying under him, he accepted him as his teacher. And similarly Nyojo Zenji right away thought, This is my disciple, who will carryon my practice. One evening during meditation, Nyojo Zenji was scolding someone who was sleeping, and at that time Dogen Zenji had an awakening. Submitting his realization to his teacher, Dogen Zenji received Dharma transmission from Nyojo Zenji. Later he returned to Japan. The first thing we notice here is that Dogen Zenji was a monk who wanted to be a sincere disciple of the Duddha. That's a. He already had given up the scholarly study of Duddhism, so his problem was how to be a good disciple from the bottom of his heart and mind. To have this spirit is the most important point. Since he was such a sincere student, he could not accept teachers who were not as sincere as he was, and he could not accept someone who was only a good speaker. He wanted to meet a monk who was really practicing Zen in its true sense. So when he saw Nyojo Zenji, he accepted him as a teacher, and when Nyojo Zenji saw him, he acknowledged Dogen's sincerity. What is sincere practice When you are not so sincere it is difficult to know, but when you are sincere you cannot accept what is superficial. Only when you become very sincere will you know what it is. It is like appreciating good art. If you want to appreciate good art the most important thing is to see good work. If you have seen a lot of good work, then when you see something that is not so good you will immediately know that it is not so good. Your eyes have become sharp enough to see. That is why Dogen Zenji put emphasis on the teacher. If you want to know what is sincerity, you should have a good teacher, because by seeing him you will know what a good teacher is. When you see a sincere person you will know what sincerity is. It is not something that I can describe. You will feel it with your intuition. That kind of intuition will be gained by seeing a good teacher. To develop your wellpolished eye, or clear, unbiased judgment, it is important to give up, or be ready to give up everything, including your understanding of the teaching and your knowledge of Buddhism. Then you will be able to tell what is good and what is bad. Many teachers gave up sutra study and only practiced zazen. They did not rely on anything, but just practiced zazen to purify their minds. Any teaching can be a good teaching for you, but because of your faulty judgment, the teaching does not make much sense. You spoil good teaching with your own judgment, but when you do not judge it, then you can accept the teaching as it is. The teaching that Dogen received from Nyojo was this great spirit, ready to give up everything. Especially when he practiced zazen, he had nothing in his mind. That purity of practice struck him. When you are trying to give up everything, you haven't given up everything yet. When you become tired of foolish discussion or foolish study, of foolish mind grasping for something to rely on, then you will seek for something called truth or true teaching. You will be completely involved in pure practice, giving up everything. My teacher, Kishizawa Roshi, was a great scholar, and his study started after he gave up everything. He didn't care for position, fame, or reputation. Whatever people said about him, he didn't mind. He continued his study and practice just to meet ancient teachers who had devoted themselves to the teaching. When you give up everything, there is no Soto or Rinzai. That was true with my teacher. Whenever he met a student or scholar, he would ask for any written teachings they might have. Whatever it was, he was very much interested in reading it. He was always seeking for his friend, seeking for his teacher. It did not matter to him whether or not the person was famous. Only when you give up everything can you see the true teacher. Even the name of Buddhism is already a dirty spot on our practice. What is important is not the teaching, but he character or effort of he student. Even to seek for enlightenment means your mind is not big enough. You are not sincere enough because you have some purpose in your study. And he desire accomplish something or even propagate Buddhism is not pure enough. Just to see someone who is holy, great, and pure is he purpose of our study of Zen or Buddhism. On hat point your teacher should be strict. When you are lazy he wiI be very angry. If you are always involved in something hat is not pure enough, you are wasting your time. As much as possible, follow your inner voice, rejecting useless things. Dogen Zenji said that if your practice is pure enough you will be supported by Buddha, so do not worry about who wiI support you or what wiI happen you. Moment after moment completey devote yourself and listen your inner voice. Then you will see someone who is great in the true sense. You will see someone who can accept you, someone whom you can accept. That is the most important point for Zen students. If you cannot accept your teacher in his way, seek for someone else. Without his kind of spirit it is almost impossible to study our way. To realize wayseeking mind is to practice zazen, and how you practice zazen is to have the right posture. Tatsugami Roshi mentioned an interesting way to practice right posture by saying, Yes. That was very good! How about my mudra Yes. How about my eyes Yes. In short, zazen is Yes. My spineYes. My chin Yes. You are not actually checking your posture. You are just accepting your posture Yes.That is zazen. There is no extra activity in your practice thatEis the spirit for you to have. There is no other secret in our practice. If you have something more than that, it is heresy. When you have some extra fancy practice, you will not reach this point. I is the same thing with the precepts, such as Don't kill. You may think that you cannot survive if you do not kill anything. But whether or not it is possible is out of the question. If the precept says, Don't kill, then you say, Yes, I will not kill. At that time you have perfect Buddha nature. When you say it is not possible, it is right or wrong, or you compare Buddhist precepts to Christian commandments, you lose the point. When you say, Okay, whether to the commandments or the precepts, there we have Buddha mind or perfect mercy. So if you notice this point there is no other secret. When you listen to your inner voice directly, without even trying to listen to it, whenever you have a chance to hear it, there is the Way. There is the voice of Buddha.Thank you very much.Most of us understand things in terms of differences such as big or small, black or white, material or spiritual. When we say spiritual, we mean something that is not material, but according to Buddhism, what is spiritual still belongs to the phenomenal side of reality. The other side, what we might call the ontological or noumenal side, is what you cannot see. Before spiritual or material, the other side is already there. It is not something that can be understood by your small mind in terms of big or small, black or white, man or woman. To understand only in this way is to put a limitation on our actual being. As long as you are trying to understand reality or you yourself in phenomenal terms it is not possible. When you understand that there is something more than spiritual or material, more than right or wrong, that is reality. That is actually each one of us. To know this is to have renunciation, to be free from ideas of right or wrong, life or death, spiritual or material.Though you try very hard to be spiritual, still you are existing.only on one side, ignoring the other side of yourself. That is why you suffer. If you really want to attain enlightenment and realize the real you, you have to go beyond ideas of good or bad, life or death. How we do this is through zazen. If something comes,let it come. Don't think about it in terms of good or bad. Let it come and let it go. That is actually zazen to go beyond various ideas and just be yourself. You and others are not just spiritual or physical. Even though a person appears to be doing something wrong, who can say for sure People may say so or you may say so, but that person is not good or bad. Society has a standard. Tentatively we have a moral code, and we say this is good and this is bad. But it may change. If the moral code or standard of judging changes, then someone who is bad today can be good tomorrow or in one or two years. Good and bad are up to the times but things themselves things themselves are not good or bad. How things go is a matter of cause and elTect. Things that exist now will cause some elTect, and that effect will cause another effect. Something that is not good and not bad is going in that way. That is reality. Not realizing this point, you tend to understand things in terms of good or bad you think there is a good person and a bad person. But I don't understand in that way. Things are just going on. If we realize this point, that is renunciation. When you sit in zazen, you are you. You cannot say, I am a good person. My practice is perfect. Of course you are perfectfrom the beginning. But it is not necessary for you to say that you are perfect. You are perfect even though you don't realize you are perfect. That is why we say we are all Buddha and our Buddha nature is constantly developing. We say that I am here and you are there. It is okay to say so, but actually without me you don't exist. Without you I don't Oexist. This is very true. Since I am here, you are there. Since you are there, I am here. You may say that even though I don't corne to Tassajara, you exist here waiting for me. Maybe so, but that is not perfect understanding. I have been at Page Street, which is related to everything, and you are also related to everything. I couldn't say goodbye to the building that is related to the freeway, trees, air, stars, moon, and sun. If I am related to the sun and moon as you are related to the sun and moon, then how is it possible to say that I am here and you are there when we are always related It is just your mind that says you are here and I am there, that's all. Originally we are one with everything. If someone dies you may say he is no more, but is it possible for something to vanish completely That is not possible, and it is not possible for something to appear a of a sudden from nothing. Something that is here cannot vanish completely. It can change its form, that's a. So we are always one. Superficially you may say you are feeling lonely, but if you are very sincere and reaUy give up your sma mind, then there is no fear and no emotional problem. Your mind is always calm, your eyes are always open, and you can hear the birds as they sing. You can see the flowers as they open. There is nothing for you to worry about. And if you worry, you will see it as an interesting novel. To read it is very interesting, but it is not something to fearor worry about. We can enjoy our life fuUy when we understand things in that way. When I was flying back from the East Coast the other day, I saw a beautiful sunset. The sunset lasts a pretty long time if you are flying towaros the west. People on the ground think it is dark and there is no more sun, but if you are flying high up in the sky you sti have the sunset, and you can see beautiful clouds. It is wonderful to see, but at the same time someone may feel very lonely. Yet wherever you are, you are one with the clouds and H .Ione with the sun and the stars that you see. Even if you jump out of the airplane, you don't go anywhere else. You are sti one with everything. That is more true than I can say, and more true than you can hear. I am not talking about something that is strange or mystical. If you think so, it means that you are not trlllhful enough. You are not feeling deeply enough to feel what is true. Be sincere enough to be yourself. That is the direction of our effort. Again, Dogen said that if you want to attain renunciation from birth and death, don't try to get out of birth and death. Birth and death are our equipment for this life. Without birth and death we cannot survive. It is our pleasure to have birth and death. That is how we understand truth. In short don't be involved in making too many homemade cookies, your ideas of big or small, good or bad. Make only as many as you need. Without food you cannot survive, so it is good to make cookies, but don't make too many. It is good to have problems, and without problems we cannot survive, blll not too many. You don't need to create more problems for yourself you have enough problems. If you really understand your life, it is not even necessary practice zazen or even for me come and stay in America. If you could make just enough homemade cookies for yourself, it would be okay for me to go back to Japan and eat Japanese cookies. Since you make too many cookies, I have to eat some. I have to help you. If we realize this point and enjoy just enough homemade cookies, that is the Buddhist way. That is how to enjoy life and that is why we practice zazen. We do not practice zazen to attain special enlightenment. Just to be ourselves and just to be free from our useless efforts or tendencies, we practice zazen.Thank you very much.Wherever You Are, Enlightenment is ThereIn our practice the most important thing is to realize that we have Buddha nature. Intellectually we may know this, but it is rather difficult to accept. Our everyday life is in the realm of good and bad, the realm of duality, while Buddha nature is found in the realm of the absolute where there is no good and no bad. There is a twofold reality. Our practice is to go beyond the realm of good and bad and to realize the absolute. It may be rather difficult to understand. Hashimoto Roshi, a famous Zen master who passed away in , said that the way we UapaneseJ cook is to prepare each ingredient separately. Rice is here and pickles are over there. But when you put them in your tummy, you don't know which is which. The soup, rice, pickles, and everything get all mixed up. That is the world of the absolute. As long as rice, pickles, and soup remain separate, they are not working. You are not being nourished. That is like your intellectual understanding or book knowledgeit remains separate from your actual life.Zazen practice is mixing the various ways we have of understanding and letting it all work together. A kerosene lamp will not work merely because it is fIlled with kerosene. It also needs air for combustion, and even with air, it needs matches. By the aid of matches, air, and kerosene, the lamp will work. This is our zazen practice. In the same way, even though you say, I have Buddha nature, that alone is not enough to make it work. If you do not have a friend or a Sangha, it won't work. When we practice with the aid of the Sangha, helped by Buddha, we can practice zazen in its true sense. We will have bright light here in the Tassajara zendo or in our daily life. To have a so called enlightenment experience is of course important, but what is more important is to know how to adjust the lame in zazen and in our everyday life. When the lame is in complete combustion, you don't smell the oil. When it is smoky you will smell something. You may realize that it is a kerosene lamp. When your life is in complete combustion you have no complaint, and there is no need to be aware of your practice. If we talk too much about zazen, it is already a smoky kerosene lamp. Maybe I am a very smoky kerosene lamp. I don't necessarily want to give a lecture. I just want to live with you: moving stones, having a nice hot spring bath, and eating something good. Zen is right there. When I start to talk, it is already a smoky kerosene lamp. As long as I must give a lecture, I have to explain: This is right practice, this is wrong, this is how to practice zazen .... It is like giving you a recipe. It doesn't work. You cannot eat a recipe. Usually a Zen master will say: Practice zazen, then you will attain enlightenment. If you attain enlightenment you will be detached from everything, and you will see tlrilgs as it is. Of course this is true, but our way is not always so. We are studying ,Ehow to adjust the flame of our lamp back and forth. Dogen Zenji makes this point in the Silobogeuzo. His teaching is to live each moment in complete combustion like a lamp or a candle. To live each moment, becoming one with everything, is the point of his teaching and his practice. Zazen practice is a very subtle thing. When you practice zazen, you become aware of things you did not notice while you were working. Today I moved stones for a while, and I didn't realize that my muscles were tired. But when I was calmly sitting zazen, I realized, Oh! My muscles are in pretty bad condition. I felt some pain in the various parts of my body. You might think you could practice zazen much better if you had no problem, but actually some problem is necessary. It doesn't have to be a big one. Through the difficulty you have you can practice zazen. This is an especially meaningful point, which is why Dogen Zenji says, Practice and enlightenment are one. Practice is something you do consciously, something you do with eTort. There! Right there is enlightenment. Many Zen masters missed this point while they were striving to attain perfect zazen: things that exist are imperfect. That is how everything actually exists in this world. Nothing we see or hear is perfect. But right there in the imperfection is perfect reality. It is true intellectually and also in the realm of practice. It is true on paper and true with our body. You think that you can only establish true practice after you attain enlightenment, but it is not so. True practice is established in delusion, in frustration. If you make some mistake, that is where to establish your practice. There is no other place for you to establish your practice. We talk about enlightenment, but in its true sense perfect enlightenment is beyond our understanding, beyond our experience. Even in our imperfect practice enlightenment is there. ' We just don't know it. So the point is to find the true meaning of practice before we attain enlightenment. Wherever you are, enlightenment is there. f you stand up right where you are, that is enlightenment. This is called don'tknow zazen. We don't know what zazen is anymore. don't know who am. To find complete composure when you don't know who you are or where you are, that is to accept ,igs as il is. Even though you don't know who you are, you accept yourself. That is you in its true sense. When you know who you are, that you will not be the real you. You may overestimate yourself quite easily, but when you say, Oh, don't know:' then you are you, and you know yourself completely. That is enlightenment. think our teaching is very, very good, but if we become arrogant and believe in ourselves too much we will be lost. There will be no teaching, no Buddhism at all. When we find the joy of our life in our composure, we don't know what it is, we don't understand anything, then our mind is very great, very wide. Our mind is open to everything, so it is big enough to know before we know something. We are grateful even before we have something. Even before we attain enlightenment, we are happy to practice our way. Otherwise we cannot attain anything in its true sense.Thank you very much.Not Sticking to EnlightenmentHui Neng, the Sixth Ancestor, said, To dwell on emptiness and to keep a calm mind is not z.azen, He also said, Just to sit in a crosslegged posture is not Zen, At the same time I always say to you, 'Just sit, If you don't understand what our practice is and stick to the words, you will be confused, but if you understand what real Zen is, you will know that the Ancestor's words are a kind of warning for us, Now our sesshin is almost at an end, and soon you will be going back to your homes and becollling involved in your everyday activity, If you have been practicing true zazen, you Illay be happy to go back to your everyday life, You may feel encouraged to go back, but if you feel hesitant to go back to your city life or everyday life, it means that you still stick to z.azen, That is why the Sixth Ancestor said, If you dwell on emptiness, and stick to your practice, then that is not true zazen, When you practice zazen, moment after moment, you accept what you have now, in this moment, and you are satisfied with everything you do, Because you just accept it, you don't have any Ocomplaints. That is zazen. Even if you cannot do that, you know what to do. Then sitting zazen will encourage you to do other things as we. Just as you accept your painful legs while sitting, you accept your everyday life, which may be more difficult than your zazen practice. If you come to have a taste of real practice, especially in this sevenday sitting, and then return to your busy activity without losing the taste of practice, that will be a great encouragement. Even though it is difficult, and even though you are busy, you will always have the taste of calmness in your mind, not because you stick to it, but because you enjoy it. When you enjoy it, you don't have to stick to it. So if you have a real taste of our practice, you can enjoy it a the time, whatever you do. You may think you have attained enlightenment, but if you are busy or in some difficulty and think you need to have that experience again, that is not real enlightenment, because it is something you are sticking to. Real enlightenment is always with you, so there is no need for you to stick to it or even to think about it. Because it is always with you, difficulty itself is enlightenment. Your busy life itself is enlightened activity. That is true enlightenment. Nowadays young people are dating, but enlightenment is not something that you can meet on a date. If you organize your life, get up at a certain time, pick up your bag lunch at a certain time, and leave for work, then if you have a girlfriend or boyfriend, you will meet them. There is no need to make a date. At a certain time she will come to the corner where you usually see her. That is our way. It is rather foolish and troublesome to make phone caUs. Even if you make a date by telephoneHey, am leaving nowif she doesn't come to the corner, you will be disappointed. If you do not make a date, and she comes to the corner, you will be reaUy happy. Ti.Mf. That is how you allain enlightenment. It is not a laughing mailer. I am talking about something real. Not to make any date means not to expect or stick to enlightenment. When you are encouraged by enlightenment, then seeing her, even just a glimpse of her, is enough. All day long you will be happy. If you are demanding too much of her, then it already means that you stick to enlightenment. That is what the Sixth Ancestor meant when he said, 'ust to dwe on emptiness is not true practice. Originally he allained enlightenment by one famous statement: Without dwelling on anything, you have true mind. So if you stick to something, you will lose your enlightenment. Even though you try hard to make a date or an appointment, it doesn't work. The enlightenment you allain in that way is something that you stick to, not something that is always with you, that always encourages you. This point is very important. Even after we finish our sesshin, continue to practice in your everyday lives and have real enlightenment. This was a very fruitful sesshin, and some of you had a good taste of our practice. Even if you haven't, I think you understand how to practice zazen. So from now on just continue to practice sincerely according to the right instruction of your teacher, and someday you will have a taste of it.Thank you very much.Usually when we practice we expect something: if we try hard, our practice will improve. If we aim at a goal in our practice, we will eventually reach it. We have the idea that our practice will improve day by day, and it will help our health and mental condition. This is true, but it is not a complete understanding. We also do zazen with the understanding that the goal is not reached in one or rwo years, but is right here. Here is the goal of practice. When you practice with this understanding, you take care of many things and you remain concentrated, completely involved in the practice you have right now. That is why we have various instructions, so that you can practice hard enough to feel the goal of practice right now, as you are doing it. You may say, My practice is not good enough to feel the goal or the full meaning right now. But even though you say your practice is not good enough, there is no other practice for you right now. Good or bad, it is your practice. To approach perfect practice, there is no way other than to accept yourself. To say your practice is bad does not help your practice. To say your practice is excellent does not help. Your practice is your practice.You are lalking abom il in various ways, good or bad, Ihal is all. We should know Ihis poim fim of all, so we say, Even Ihough your praclice is nI so good, Ihat is perfecl praclice. I sil. Hearing Ihis, you may undemand il objeclively and use il as an excuse: Anyway, we arc silling here in Ihe zendo, so Ihal is perfecI praclice. There is no need encourage ourselves, and there is no need to sit all day long. If we sit a lillie bil, Ihal is okay, even one period is enough. ThaI kind of underslanding is very superficial. You have no underslanding from your subjeclive side. Trulh is always here. I jusl say so, when you are nI aClually practicing Ihe !rUlh, is whal we call a paimed cake, a piclure of a cake Ihal you cannol cal. Even Ihough you are silling, you are ealing a paimed cake. So there is no las Ie, and you will give up because il doesn'l mean anylhing: I doesn'l result in anylhing, so il may be beller go dow mown eal somelhing, inslead of eating Ihe food Zen Cemer provides. You may be pleased when people call you a Zen slUdem. Then your praclice is encouraging your ego, bUl you are nI praclicing Zen. When you sil like Ihal, Zen does nI mean anylhing. True zazen cannI be like Ihal. If Zen were like Ihal, il would have vanished from Ihis world a long lime ago. Zen is slill alive because of Ihe olher side of Ihe muh. Various anceslors and greal sages of Buddhism have said, Buddha left this leachingjusl for me, nOl for anyone else. Buddha lefl ',e Lolli Ira jusl for Nichiren. If Ihal side is forgollen, Ihe Buddha's leaching is nOlhing bm waslepaper. Just for me is nI arrogance. I means you have full apprecialion of Ihe leaching as your own. ThaI is Ihe spiril we need in our zazen praclice. Everyone can be Nichiren everyone can be Dogen or Bodhidharma. Because I practice zazen, there is Buddha, there is Dogen and Bodhidhanna, and there is Buddha's leaching. You realize Ihal you are the only being in Ihis world, and Ihal no one can lake over yourOposition. That is trueall the teaching is just for you. When you are young, you have no such feeling. You think you will live fifty or even one hundred years more, so today is not so valuable to you. If you become my age, you will really feel, I am just this one being. No one can take over my position, so must not fool myself. This point is very important for everyone, but especially for those who practice our way. Without this confidence or understanding, you will expose the weakness of your practice: Oh, no, I am not good enough. Look at meI cannot practice zazen. Zen is so beautiful and so perfect, but it is impossible for me to do this practice. You will feel the weaknesses of your character and of your conduct, and being preoccupied in this way, you won't be able to sit. But whatever you say about yourself, you are the only one. You cannot escape, because the whole world is yours. This is beyond the truth that we can talk about. This is ultimate truth. How can you deny the fact that you are the only one You can criticize yourself that is easy. But when you accept the fact that you are the only one, you have no time to say good practice or bad practice. Because you turn a deaf ear to this truth, you have time to criticize yourself. When you realize this point, you can hear or see the truth, and you can practice zazen. You can accept the truth, whatever it is. To practice is to open yourself up to everything you see as an embodiment of the truth. This is why we practice zazen, why everyone can join our practice, and why this practice includes every activity in your life. This is not a practice that can be compared to other practices as a means of attaining something. From the experiences of many people, instructions were accumulated for the forms we use and the way we breathe, just as scientific knowledge is accumulated. But Buddhist wisdom puts emphasis on the subjective side ..Uof the truth. That is why we say everyone is Buddha. That is how we transmit Huddha's teaching to everyone. t is not just a paper transmission. The subjective side has always been with us, and this point has always been emphasized without losing the objective side of the truth. Sometimes people who call themselves spiritual ignore the objective side of the truth. That is also a nustake, but to be caught by the objective side of the truth and rely on it with an idle attitude will not help. Even though we can go to the moon, it doesn't help so much. As long as we rely on objective, scientific truth, it doesn't help. Only when each one of us feels the truth, appreciates, accepts, and is ready to follow the truth, will it work. When someone puts himself outside of the truth in order to study the truth, he won't know what to do when something happens to him. n an ancient Chinese story, there was a person who liked dragons very much. He talked about dragons, he painted dragons, and he bought various kinds of dragons. So there was a dragon who thought, f a real dragon like me visited him, he would be very happy. One day the real dragon sneaked into his room, and the man didn't know what to do! Wl,aaail! He could not even run away. He could not even stand up. For a long time we have been like the man who admired dragons, but we should not just be the dragon's friend or adnurer we should be the dragon itself. Then we will not be afraid of any dragon. So we are ready to study our way subjectively as well as objectively. When you practice in this way, zazen will become your own zazen, and as you are Huddha, you will express your true nature in various ways. That is freedom from the forms of practice. Whatever you do, you will really be you. You will be Buddha, in its true sense. There is a big dilTerence between prac Otice with this understanding and lazy practice with poor, superficial understanding of form, instruction, and teaching. After all, as Buddha said, there is no one you can rely on, so you should be the boss of everything. Then you will understand Buddha's teaching and our practice as your own.Thank you very much.Stand Up by the GroundWhen we talk about reality, it is to understand how to practice our way in zazen and in our everyday life. Dogen Zenji talked about the nature of reality by using the Chinese or Japanese word, , which can mean like this or just this, but can also be a question, What is this can also be it. In English you say, It is hot. That it is the same word, the same meaning as when you say, It is nine o'clock. You use it for the time or the weather, but not only for the time or weather, everything is actually it. We are also it, you know, but we don't say it. Instead of it we say he or she, me or .. But actually we mean, it. So if everything is it, it is at the same time a question mark. When I say it, you won't know exactly what I mean, so you may ask, Whatis 'it' When we talk about time, it may be mealtime or lecture time. We don't know, so it may be a question mark for everyone. You may say, What time is it or Is it time for lecture So it or ,,,, is something definite, and at the same time, a Oquestion. And this is very important for us to know. Right now it is hot, but it is not always hot. Sometime it will be cold. When we talk about time, we can see that time is continuous and also that time is definite. When we say it is halfpast eight, we point out a certain time. Now time is discontinuous. But time by its nature is continuous, so the one word has two sides: continuity and discontinuity. That is the nature of reality. Dogen Zenji talks about practice not as something special, but something continuous, something mixed up with everything. He says: If you fall on the ground, stand up by the ground. Does it make sense If you fall on the ground, you stand up by the ground in that place. Also he says, If you fall on the ground, stand up by emptiness, by nothing. Without discussing why this is so, we cannot have a complete understanding of our teaching. Actually we stand up by the ground like this, but he says that we shouldn't. What does it mean If you think you can always stand up by the ground, and don't mind falling on the ground, you will fall on the ground quite easily. You will have the idea: It is all right. If I fall to the ground, I can stand up by the ground. If we practice with this kind of prejudice or easy idea, that is wrong practice. This point is important. It is like enlightenment. If you rely on enlightenment, you will be someone who easily makes mistakes or falls on the ground, relying on the help of the ground. Do you understand It is a very subtle point. Of course we have to stand up by the ground, but if we stick to the idea of the help of the ground all the time, we will lose the true meaning of the fall to the ground. In other words. even though we make a mistake, we should not make the same mistake many. many times. thinking it is all right because we know how to get up. This is not what we mean when we say reality. Things do not happen twice in the same way. The ground is not always the Dur Y Til Dsame. It can be a stick sometimes, or it can be a stone. It can even be water. The ground is it, you know. It means everything, not just ground. It means to practice our way without trying to repeat the same experience. So there is nothing to rely on in our practice. But on the other hand, there is always something provided for you, always. According to the circumstances, you will have some aid to practice our way. Even the pain in your legs is an aid. By the pain you have, you practice our way. The pain is it. It is everything, but at that time, it is some definite experience or particular trouble. It can be drowsiness it can be hunger it can be hot weather. So hot weather or nice cool weather, or hunger, or mosquitoes, or the pain in your legs can be an aid to your practice with which you can stand up and establish your practice. So not only Buddha's teaching, but everything can be an aid to us. Oj means things, and is someone who is practicing zazen. Someone practicing somethingthat is reality. Or we could say, someone doing something. Then is a discontinuous, particular being which has form and color. But as Dogen Zenji says, Zen practice is something continuous, something mixed up with everything. If it is so, then someone doing zazen already includes everything. Someone cannot be separate from this world. Some action cannot exist without the background of the whole world, and some thing cannot be apart from other things. So someone, doing, and something is the same thing, you know. If they are the same thing, then we can say something something something. What is that That is complete realization. Everything happens in this way. So if you stick to the idea of help or enlightenment, that is already a mistake. You have separated yourself from everything.Someone may say, Oh, he studies Soto Zen, but he denies the'Oenlightenment experiencc. It is not so. We Soto students do not stick to anything. We havc complete frecdom of practice, complete freedom of cxpres.ion. Our practice is the living cxpression of our truc nature or realiry. So for us it is not possiblc to stick to anything. Moment after momcnt, we practice in a renewed, refreshed way. Our practice should be indcpcndcnt from past practice and future practice. We cannot sacrifice our present practice for some future attainment, because a the Buddhas attained enlightenment in this way, and a the Buddhas in thc future will attain enlightenment in this way. In this way means not any particular way. Sometimes it may be Soto way, sometimes .inzai. According to the circumstances, it may bc the way of another school. Someone may attain enlightenment when he sees a Rower or hears a sound. Someone may attain enlightenment when taking a hot bath or going to the rest room. Rich and poor may attain enlightenment in various ways. So actually there is not a Soto way or a Rinzai way. We have discusscd praCice rather abstractly, but this is what it means: whatever it is, we should accept it. By various means moment after moment, we practice our way. There is no other way to attain enlightenment.Thank you very much.Just Enough ProblemsThis is the seventh and last day of our sesshin. We have already come this far, so we cannot give up! The only way is to stay here. I feel I have a very good crop. You may feel you are not yet ripe, but even though you are still ripening, if you stay in our storehouse, you will be good apples. So I have nothing to worry about, and I don't think you have any reason to worry about your practice either. Some of you may have started this sesshin because you had many problems. You thought that if you sat here for seven days your problems would be solved, but whatever problems you may have, they can be solved anyway. Buddha will not give you more problems than you can solve, or more than you need. Whatever the problems are, they are just enough. If these are not enough problems. Buddha is ready to give you more, just so you can appreciate your problems. Buddha is always giving you something. If you have nothing to cope with, your life feels empty. So I think you should trust Buddha. A life without problems is like sitting in this zendo for seven days without doing anything. . Here in the zendo meditating for seven days, you have had many problems. You might think you have more problems while sitting than you have in your daily life. Actually you arc finding the problems you have had all along, but didn't notice because you were fooled by something. When you are not aware of your problems, they will appear unexpectedly. No problem will appear that you did not originally have, but because you overlook it, you do not expect it. So it is better to see your problems as soon as possible. Soto students sit zazen facing the wall. Buddha is there behind you, and you are trusting him. If you trust completely, there is no need to face Buddha. This is an attitude of complete trust. Your enemies or problems will come from the back, not from the front. So to expose your back to Buddha means to express complete trust in the Buddha. Even though you feel you have too many problems, when you trust in Buddha, you sit with your problems. At the same time, you should be ready to refuse a problem if it is too much. Buddha may say, If you really don't need it, I will accept it at any time. Give it back to me. But more and more the problem will change into something you need. You will think, If I refuse this problem, I may regret it. Since I am not so sure whether this is a real problem or Buddha's help, maybe it is better to keep it. If you sit in this way, you will find that your problems are valuable treasures that are indispensable for you. Before you accept the problems you have in your position, you cannot accept yourself as you are. You cannot sit in a true way. When you steady your mind, trust Buddha, and just sit, there is no confusion or problem anymore. When you are patient enough and wait until the problem makes some sense to you, you can appreciate your being here and your position, whatever it may be. That is how you practice zazen. When you practice zazen, there is no need to expect Buddha to help you solve your problems. Buddha is already helping you, but usually we refuse Buddha's offer. When you ask for help, you are asking for something that has not yet arrived. You are refusing to accept the treasure you already have. You are like a pig. When I w. young, as my father w. very poor, he raised pigs. If you give pigs a bucket of food, as long as you remain there they will not eat it, expecting you to give them more food. If you move away too quickly, they will kick over the food bucket chasing after you. So you must be very careful. I think that is what you do. Instead of working with the problems you have, you cause yourself more problems by seeking for something else. But there is no need to seek for anything. You have plenty of problems,just enough. This is a mysterious thing, the mystery of life. We have just enough problems, not too many and not too few. So there is no need to ask anyone's help. If you are patient enough, if you are strong enough to accept your problems, then you can sit calmly and peacefully, trusting Buddha and trusting your own being. Because you are helped, and the w.Jy you are helped is perfect, you exist here. If it is too much, you will die, and if it is too little, you will die. You are receiving just what you need. So the only way is to trust Buddha, to trust your being here. That is what we call Zen. You may think all the Zen masters are very tough. He looks tough when you need him to be tough, but he is not so toughhe is just tough enough for you, that's a! Actually, you don't need your master, if you know how to practice zazen. I w.Jnt you just to sit and to be ready to go to the marketplace as ripe apples. Let's sit with full appreciation for our practice.Thank you very much.SunFaced Buddha, MoonFaced BuddhaLately I have been sick, and because I have been practicing zazen for many years, some people may say, He will not catch cold or sulfer from the flu ... but isn't it funny he stayed in bed so long We may believe that zazen will make us physically strong and mentally healthy, but a healthy mind is not just healthy in the usual sense, and a weak body is not just a weak body. Whether it is weak or strong, when that weakness or strength is based on what we call truth, or Buddha nature, then that is a healthy mind and a healthy body. My voice may not be very good yet, but today 'm testing it. Whether it works or not, or if I speak or not, is not a big problem. Whatever happens to us is something that should happen. The purpose of our practice is to have this kind of complete composure. In the Blue Cliff Record there is a koan concerning Baso Doitsu. Baso was big and physically very strong, a man of great stature. Once when Baso was ill, the monk who took care of the temple NfCr:,:Cr:Acame to visit him and asked, How are you doing Are you we, or not And Baso said, Sunfaced Buddha, Moonfaced Buddha. The Sunfaced Buddha is supposed to live for one thousand eight hundred years. And the Moonfaced Buddha lives only one day and one night. When I am sick, I may be the Moonfaced Buddha. When I am heahhy, I am the Sunfaced Buddha. But the Sunfaced Buddha or the Moonfaced Buddha has no special meaning. Whether I am ill or healthy, I am slilJ practicing zazen. There is no difference. Even though I am in bed, I am Buddha. So don't worry about my health. This is quite simple. Whatever happens to Baso, he can accept trillgs as it is, but we cannot accept everything. We may accept something we think is good, but if we dislike something we won't accept it. And we compare things: He is a true Zen master, and he is not, or, he is a good Zen student, but I am not. That kind of understanding may be quite usual, bm finaUy you cannot figure out which idea is reliable. The point is to anain complete composure. Ordinary effort associated with comparative thinking will not help you. To anain enlightenment means we have complete composure in our life, without any discrimination. At the same time this docs not mean to stick to the anitude of nondiscrimination, because that is also a kind of discrimination. When I was still in Japan, I had some Zen students. Some of them were very rich and inRuential others were students, carpenters, or other kinds of workers. In Japan we treat some people, a mayor or a teacher, in a different way. We have a special way of speaking to them. But I always told my students, If you are a Zen student you should forget a about your position, work, or title. Otherwise you cannot practice zazen in its true sense.Whenyou are sitting I say, Don'tthink. Don't thinkOmeans not to treat things in terms of good or bad, heavy or light. Just accept Iings as il is. Even though you do not think, you may hear something and usually the moment you hear it, your reaction is, What could it be That is a car, or That's very noisy. Maybe it's a motorcycle. In zazen you should just hear the big noise or the small noise, and not be bothered by it. It may seem impossible, especially for a beginner, because the moment you hear it, a reaction follows. But, if you practice zazen, if you continuously just accept Iis as il is, eventually you can do it. The way you can do it is to concentrate on your posture or your breathing. In Japan the samurai practiced zazen to master the sword. As long as he was afraid of losing his life, he could not act with his full ability. When he was free from the idea of killing or being killed, he could just react to his enemy's activity, and win. If he tried to win, he might lose. So practicing how to act without fear, which limits your activity, is the most important thing. Although it was a mailer of surviving on the battlefield, the samurai fought his fight in the zendo. When we don't have that kind of circumstance in our everyday life, we don't feel the same necessity to practice. But our human problems are created because we make an effort to achieve something, and this limits our activity. Then we cannot achieve anything. We should understand our everyday activity in two ways, and be able to react either way without a problem. One way is to understand dualisticallygood or bad, right or wrongand we try hard to understand things in these terms. Yet we should also be able to let go of this dualistic understanding. Then everything is one. That is the other understanding, the understanding of oneness.So you should be able to understand or accept things in theseNfUnnll,!!!Atwo ways, but this is not enough. It is still dualistic. Without thinking, This is one of two understandings, you have the freedom to move from one to the other. Then you wiI not be caught by your understanding. Whatever you do wiI be the great activity of practice. The Sunfaced Buddha is good the Moonfaced Buddha is good. Whatever it is, that is gooda things are Buddha. And there is no Buddha, even. When you do not understand Buddha, you wiI be concerned if I say there is no Buddha: You are a priest, so how can you say there is no Buddha Why do you chant Why do you bow to Buddha There is no Buddha so we bow to Buddha. If you bow to Buddha because there is Buddha, that is not a true understanding of Buddha. Sunfaced Buddha, Moonfaced Buddha no problem. Whether I am at Tassajara or San Francisco, no problem. Even though I die, it is a right with me, and it is a right with you. And if it is not all right, you are not a Zen student. It is lJuile a right. That is Buddha. If I suTer while I am dying, that is suffering Buddha, and there is no confusion in it. Maybe everyone wiI struggle because of physical agony or spiritual agony, but that is not a problem. We should be very grateful to have a limited body like yours or mine. If you had a limitless life, it would be a great problem for you. On my wife's favorite V program there are some ghosts of people who lived long ago. They appear in this world, and create many problems for themselves and others. That is what happens. A human being is a human being, and we can enjoy our life only with our limited body. This limitation is vital. Without limitation nothing exists, so we should enjoy it: weak body, strong body man or woman. The only way to enjoy our life is to enjoy the limitation that is given to us.Sunfaced Buddha, Moonfaced Buddha does not mean toObe indifferent: I don't care whether it' the Sunfaced Buddha or the Moonfaced Buddha. It means that whatever it is, we just enjoy it. This is also beyond nonattachment, because when our attachment reaches the point of nonattachment, that is real attachment. If you are attached to something, be attached to something completely. , ! I am here. I am right here. This kind of confidence is important. When you have this kind of confidence in yourself, in your being, you can practice true zazen beyond perfect or imperfect, good or bad.Thank you very much.Sitting like a FrogRecently on a calendar I saw one of Sengai's drawings of a frog along with Sengai's saying, If we can become a Buddha by the practice of silting.... He doesn't say anything more, but wecan imagine what the frog is thinking: If people can become a Buddha by the practice of silting, then I too can be a Buddha. laughs For those of us who have some understanding of practice, when we see someone silting to attain enlightenment, we may think, Oh, he is silting like a frog. Actually a frog's way of silting is much better than our zazen. I always admire their practice. They never get sleepy. Their eyes are always open, and they do things intuitively in an appropriate way. When something to eat comes by, they go like this: elllp! They never miss anything, they are always calm and still. I wish I could be a frog. If you understand what Sengai is saying in his picture of a frog, you have already understood what Zen is. There is a lot of humor in his picture and a good understanding of our practice. Even though our practice is not belter than a frog's, we continue IpOto sit. When you have been practicing for a pre try long time, you will laugh, pardy at someone who is involved in the wrong idea of practice, and pardy at yourself who is always sitting, without doing anything, without making much progres.. You will laugh at yourself. When you can laugh at yourself, there is enlightenment. Still your zazen may be a beginner's zazen or sometimes worse than a beginner's. Sometimes I m ashamed of myself when I see a student who is practicing very we: Oh, he is very good. I wish I could be that young again, but it is too late. Anyway, our practice cannot be better than a frog sitting, but that is okay. To see someone practicing good zazen is inspiring, not only for me, but for everyone. If your zazen is good enough to give a good impression, then your zazen is pretry good even though you don't think so. Likewise, even though you think your zazen is very good and you are proud of your enlightenment experience, if your zazen does not inspire anyone, it may be wrong practice. When we talk about the precepts we say not to do this or not to do that, but if you are doing something good like zazen you cannot do something bad at the same time. If you continue to do something good, that is how to observe our precepts. So the point is just to sit, forgetting all about fame or profit. Just sit for the sake of zazen. That is to have real wayseeking mind, to find out your inmost desire. The practice of wayseeking mind will sharpen your intuition. Then you will have less difficulry knowing what to choose. To make a choice you try to know what is good and what is bad, so that by comparing one thing to another you can buy or get something good. Maybe you are trying to pick out fabric from all the various colors and materials, but even though you spend two or three days you may end up getting something that is not appropriate for you. You will return to the same store. If they exchange it for something else, you are lucky. Don't say this kind of practice is useles.. t is actually the first step on our way. How to have good practice and how to buy something appropriate for yourself is the same. When you are not overly involved in it and shopping too much, then you can get something appropriate. When you know the secret of how to use your intuitive sense, your activiry will be free from v:lrious restrictions, and you will find your way in your everyday life. Until you understand why we practice zazen and what is actually true activiry, intuitive activiry, free from various desires and restrictions, it is difficult to figure out what is good practice. Still it is okay to continue practicing, and little by little without knowing how to acquire that kind of intuitive activiry, you will get it anyway. So it is rather foolish to be involved in some hard special practice. Zazen practice is hard enough, and only through zazen practice have various teachers attainedthere is no other word, so sayattainedenightenment and become real Buddhists. f you understand real practice, then archery or other activities can be Zen. f you don't understand how to practice archery in its true sense, then even though you practice very hard, what you acquire is just technique. t won't help you through and through. Perhaps you can hit the mark without trying, but without a bow and arrow you cannot do anything. f you understand the point of practice, then even without a bow and arrow the archery will help you. How you get that kind of power or abiliry is only through right practice. Dogen Zenji says that to have right practice is to have a good teacher and to receive right guidance. Otherwise you will not understand Zen. Just to continue this right practice or fundamental practice is the most important thing.Thank you very much.Real Precepts Are Beyond WordsWhen I say precepts, what you will think of is something like the Ten Commandments or the grave Prohibitory Precepts. But Zen precepts are not like that. To start with, the phrase Zen precepts means understanding zazen. So another interpretation of zazen is the precepts. Using words, we explain what Zen actually is. The purpose of receiving the precepts is not just to remember what you should or what you should not do. The way we observe precepts is by practicing Zen, or by extending our practice to our daily life. So our idea of precepts is completely different from the usual understanding of precepts.The foundation or true meaning of the precepts is based on the various ways of understanding the one reality which is always with you, the reality which is not divisible into three, or sixteen, or ten. Tentatively, we divide. We explain from various angles. But that is just words. Real precepts are beyond words. We cannot talk about it. If we talk about it, already it is no longer the precepts. So if you think the meaning of the precepts is just to observe various rules, your understanding is very far away from the true understanding of the real precepts.The first of the sixteen precepts we observe is the one reality which cannot be divided into three or sixteen. It is the precept of one reality. You may call it emptiness or you may call it the absolute. That is the first precept we receive and observe. All the precepts start from this precept. Without understanding this precept, our sixteen precepts dont make any sense.Whatever there is in this world or this universe, whatever kinds of rules we have or whatever kind of truth we can observe, all those are included in this big scale of the precepts. We understand the precepts in various ways. Scientists understand in their own way and religious people understand in a religious way. There must be various ways of understanding it. But what we study, what we observe, is the one precept. That is what we receive when we receive the sixteen precepts. You may understand, then, that how you receive the precepts is to just practice zazen, just to be yourself. Then you can observe the precepts.It looks like I am talking about something like heaven, but it is not so. I am talking about each one of you, and myself, and about water, and about stuff. When stuff is really stuff, stuff includes everything. When you just practice zazen on your black cushion, your practice includes everything and you practice zazen with Buddha, with the patriarchs, and with all sentient beings. That is what I repeat, over and over. Whether your practice is good or bad, it doesnt matter. If you accept your practice as your own, then that practice includes everything. At that time, you have the precepts which include everything, as absolute being includes everything.We say that something which includes everything is the absolute. But, actually, it is more than that. It is beyond our understanding. You may think that if you add up all the beings which exist in this universe that that is the absolute. But it is not so because the absolute cannot be understood by your mind. Something which you understand is already not absolute, because your mind limits the real understanding of the absolute. When you dont understand and just sit, when you become just a stone, or stuff, then you include everything. That is our zazen practice. This is such an important point for us. If you lose this point, you will easily be caught by some idea, or some experience, in your practice. My practice is good, very good. Recently I saw Buddha in zazen. laughs All the Buddhas came to me and admired my practice. We are laughing, but that kind of practice exists and some people practice this kind of practice very sincerely. It is good practice, but even so, the practice of just sitting is beyond comparison. Just to sit is much better than to see all the Buddhas in the world. Do you understand why That is the point, to know what an important practice it is just to be yourself.Before I could read English, Alan Watts helped me to express this, When stone is completely stone, that is real stone. He put this Zen expression into words. When a stone is a stone through and through, that is really a stone. Not only is it really a stone, but when it is really a stone, it includes everything. When it is not a stone, someone may kick it , but when it is really a stone, you cannot do anything with it. When a stone is really a stone you cannot pick it up. Even though you think you picked it up, it is still part of the universe. You cannot pick up the whole universe. If you say you can pick up the whole universe, where are you If you are a ghost, you are outside the universe, where are you If you are a ghost, outside the universe, that is just delusion. Nothing exists outside of the universe. All that exists is within the universe. So, thinking that you picked up a stone is a big delusion. Stone is still stone. You cannot do anything with it. If you understand this point and sit zazen, that is how you receive the precepts. This is the only way to observe perfect precepts. There is no other way to observe the precepts. This is called the indivisible precepts.We say Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. I have been talking about the Buddha precept, which cannot be divided into three. The next one is the Dharma precept which is the law of the universe. There is some way in which things are always going. If you throw something up, it will eventually come to the earth because of the law of gravity. So there are some rules in the way things exist. So if we say rule, or law, that rule or law includes everything. Nothing is free from that law. That is Dharma. You may say you have complete freedom., but if you exist outside the law, you are a ghost. That is your own delusion. Actually nothing exists outside of the rules. That is why the second precept is called the pure law, or pure precept. Pure means nondualistic. When something is in duality, it is not pure. Usually, when you say pure, it is the opposite of impure. And when you say good, good is the opposite of bad. Good and bad are a pair of opposites. Then there is already separation. When we say pure, it means nonduality.When you sit, if you say, My practice is good, that is already dualistic. Whether you say good practice or bad practice, you are right there, sitting. You cannot say good practice or bad practice. There is some reason why someones practice is the way it is. If someone cannot sit with a straight back there is some reason. So you cannot say good or bad. That is how he or she practices zazen. For her there is no other way to sit. She is making her best effort, and she practices zazen just to make her effort. She is sitting to be a complete being. She is sitting, not to attain enlightenment or to keep from falling into hell. She is just sitting. No one can criticize her practice. If she criticizes her practice, she is not making her best effort. When she is making her best effort, she cannot criticize, and she will not feel regretful about her practice. That is her own practice. To continue this kind of practice, day after day, is the way we exist, how we live as a good Buddhist. That is how we keep our precepts.Anyway, there are some rules, and some reason why each person exists here. There is some reason why a plant is a plant and a star is a star. So when you say Dharma, Dharma includes everything. Dharma is another name of the Buddha, the absolute one.The third one is Sangha precept. Sangha means to be harmonious. Buddha and the law of the universe are not two. When Buddha and the law of the universe are not two, and when someone who is practicing zazen, Buddha and his law are one, that is complete harmony. It is more than harmony it is actually one. So, we say the precepts cannot be divided into three, but we can explain it in three ways. My practice, my zazen itself, is the precepts. That is one interpretation, one way of understanding the precepts.There are rules you know. If I do something good, the result will be good. You cannot escape from the law of karma. If you understand it in that way, then that rule, or that law, includes everything. We say, the law of karma. You cannot escape from karma. Nothing can escape from karma. There is always some rule. The rule is how everything exists, so it is the same thing as Buddha himself. When we say Buddha, Buddha acts with karma, by karma, or for karma. So karma and Buddha are the same. And , as Buddhas disciple, am always one with Buddha. We cannot escape from it, so we call it the indivisible precept. We cannot divide it into three.Now you are listening to my lecture, and you may study many Buddhistbooks. The books you read are not Buddhism itself, but an explanation of this truth. Form is emptiness, emptiness is form. If we explain it like this, it is the study of thePrajna Paramitagroup of sutras. If we put emphasis on how to be Buddha, or why we are Buddha, then that is the study of theLotus Sutra.What you study by doing koans is the relationship between our practice and reality. We have a glance at truth, or enlightenment, or Buddha, which is always one, which is not divisible, and which cannot be explained in words. Through koan practice, you will have a glance at the truth, Oh, this is reality! That is koan practice. Whatever you say, whatever you write, it is one of the ways to put reality into words. If you are an artist, what you work on is how to convey your understanding of the truth.The study of Buddhism, of course, is included in our study of precepts. To observe the precepts is not just observing ten prohibitory precepts, do not kill, do not steal, etc. Those are precepts, but, even though you observe the ten precepts completely, that is not how you observe our real precepts. So we are not interested in explaining the two hundred and fifty, or more, precepts....Anyway, the point is not to observe those precepts one after another. The point is how to be yourself... Then you have the precepts.... So the best way is just to be you yourself, then the precepts are with you always.People may ask, What are you doing at Zen Center What kind of practice do you have at Zen Center There may be many ways, but, in short, to be oneself is the purpose of our practice. How to be oneself, and how to keep the precepts, Buddhas precepts, is our point of practice. Those are the three indivisible precepts: Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.The next one Im not continuing my lecture anymore laughs because you may get hungry if I continue. The other three are the Three Collective Pure Precepts collection of all the goodies. Those are another three precepts. How about it Collection of all the goodies precepts, laughs and we have ten more. Those are the Ten Prohibitory Precepts. Altogether, there are sixteen precepts, and we tentatively explain the framework of Buddhism by the explanation of the precepts. So the precepts are not just rules. They are a direct explanation of our life and Buddhas teaching and zazen practice. That is why it is important for you to receive the precepts.Thank you very much.How to Observe the PreceptsThis morning I want to talk about Zen, Zen precepts. As you know, the real meaning of precepts is not just rules, but is rather our way of life. When we organize our life, you see something like rules even though you are not intending to observe some particular rule, the rules are always there. As soon as you get up, in order to wake up completely, you wash your face. That is a precept, one of the precepts. And at a certain time you eat breakfast, when you become hungry that is, you are observing some rules when you eat breakfast at some certain time. It is actually the way of life you follow naturally. So if you practice zazen there will be rules in your practice. So, at the same time, zazen practice is precepts, one of the precepts and all of the precepts. If you really understand how Buddhists come to the idea of precepts you will understand the relationship between Zen and the precepts. Precepts are just our way of life.As a Zen student we put emphasis on our everyday practice, including zazen practice. And when you think about how to cope with the problems you have in your everyday life, you will realize how important it is to practice zazen. Only the power of practice will help you in a true sense.For instance, when you hit themokugyo, or wooden drum, if you try to control the chanting, if you think, This is too fast, so I must make the chanting slower, or Oh, this is too slow, I must make it a little bit faster, if you try to do it by way of your hand or your mind, it doesnt work. Only when you do it from yourharaby the feeling you have in your zazen practice, can you do it. Just by your mind or your hand, you cannot do anything. It does not work. The students will not follow yourmokugyo.Only when you do it with your zazen power can you control it. When you can control yourself very well without having any idea of controlling anything when you set the right pace, then you can control yourself. And when you can control yourself just as you sit in zazen posture, then you can control the chanting perfectly. This is also true with your everyday practice.When you do something just through your skill or just by your mind, you will not be supported by people and so you will not help others. Only when you do it with zazen mind can you help others, and you will be naturally supported by the people. So if the precepts are just some moral code which you have in your mind, those precepts will not work at all. When you forget all the precepts and, without trying to, observe them in the same way as you eat when you are hungry, then naturally precepts are there. When you forget all about precepts and when you can observe them quite naturally, that is how you keep the precepts, precepts are there.In your zazen practice you just sit. You have no idea of attaining anything. You just sit. What do we mean by just sit When we just sit we already include everything and we are not simply a part of this cosmic being we are one with everything. This is just an explanation, but the feeling is that you include everything, and actually this is not true just for zazen. When you drink a cup of tea, that activity includes everything. Actually it is so. When you say this is tea, and this is me, it does not include everything you are here and tea is there. This is just tea and it does not include everything. But when you drink it without any idea of tasting what it is, being completely one with the tea, then you have no idea of tea and no idea of you. This activity includes everything. So, as Dogen Zenji said, if your everyday activity does not include everything, it is not Buddhist activity. It seems almost impossible to feel that way, but actually if you realize, if you experience what is zazen practice, then you will understand what is our everyday life and how everyday life should be for yourself, for others, and for each activity. You will realize that each activity should be zazen.The words of the famous Zen Master Ummon are often used as koans, and are very well known for their subtlety. The point of his words is difficult to explain, the only way to understand his words is through practice. It is almost impossible to understand through words, but he tried to express it in Zenmondo, question and answer, in various ways. Later Zen Masters said Ummons words are like a cup and its lid which fit perfectly. Or, we can say, follow the wave and drive the wave. Do you understand The boat follows the wave and drives the way like themokugyofollows the chanting and drives the chanting. If you just follow the chanting, themokugyowill get slower and slower still, unless you listen you will lose control. So you have to listen and at the same time you should lead, you should drive the chanting. It is not just to follow the chanting, you should drive the chanting too. Following the chanting and driving the chanting. How do you do it If you asked Ummon how you do it, he may say, What are you thinking about He may say, Just sit.How can I make the perfect cover for this cup The only way is to make a lid and cover it. But if you think too much about it and if you work on it too much, the lid will become smaller and smaller and it will not fit. If you do not observe the cup, it may be too big. Observing the cup and making the cup, that is the way and that is how you practice zazen. That is the power of practice.So to know the center of things, or to have a whole picture of things or events, is the point of practice. And how you do it is to find, to know the center of yourself. When you know where your center is in zazen, that is the center of yourself and everything. When you do not lose your center wherever you are, it means that you are boss. But, if you lose your center you are already mixed up and, even though you insist yourself, you are not in the center.How you keep the precepts is how you organize your life. And how you organize your life is how we practice zazen. This point can be explained in various ways. When we practice zazen there is nothing outside of us everything, whole being, is included in our practice. So the merit of practice is just for you, yourself, because there is just one whole being. There is no you and no objective world. Objective world and subjective world are one and the same in our practice.We explain it in this way, but that is just an explanation of our zazen practice. When you just sit without being involved in the thinking mind or emotional activity, when you just remain on your black cushion, then that is the practice we mean which is explained in various ways. So as Bodhidharma said no merit. What will be the merit of practice No merit. Because there is nothing but practice, there is no merit to give to anyone or to have for yourself. Merit itself is zazen. Zazen itself is merit. So no merit, just zazen. If you say merit, there is no zazen. So he said no merit. Whatever you do there is no merit. If there is merit, that is dualistic practice. If you observe precepts in that way, that is heresy. If you think I have to observe the ten precepts, one by one, that is wrong practice.For a long time, many Buddhists tried to observe our precepts with great effort. But that kind of practice violates the precepts because observed in that way, precepts become dualistic, something outside ourselves. I have to observe the precepts! That is not the way we practice zazen. For Mahayana Buddhists dualistic practice is a violation of practice. Why is it Because when we observe rigidly, or when we are caught by precepts, what will happen This may also be a violation of the precepts.There are precepts, but you know, precepts should be observed without any idea of observing. That is how to practice, how to observe the precepts. In short, when you observe precepts in the same way as you practice zazen, that is perfectly transmitted precepts from Buddha to us. So as Mahayana Buddhists, whether or not we know each of the sixteen precepts or the two hundred and fifty precepts, we should still be able to observe precepts. And when we practice zazen, we should not practice in such a way that w think this is just zazen. This zazen includes all the various studies of Buddhism.This morning when I joined you I felt a deep feeling. I think that is because you were sitting just before you came to lecture. This kind of feeling is important. This is real sangha. With this feeling I think we can carry on our practice and our life in this zendo and in this building.Thank you very much.The Manifested Three Treasures, Part Today I will explain Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. Originally, Buddha is the one who attained enlightenment under the Bodhi Tree and became a teacher of all Buddhist teachers. Dharma is the teaching which was spoken by Buddha, and Sangha is the group who studied under Buddha. This way of understanding Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha is called the Manifested Three Treasures, or as we say in Japanese,Genzen Sambo.Genzenmeans to appear. Of course, whether Buddha appeared or not, there is Truth. But if there is no one who realizes the truth, the truth means nothing to us. So in this sense we say the manifestation of truth, and the manifestation of truth is Sangha.People who join the practice with harmony and unity are called Sangha. The meaning of Sangha is not only this group of people, but also the state of harmony or unity. Truth itself is Dharma, and the truth which is not divided into various forms is called Buddha, which is another interpretation of the Three Treasures. This understanding is called one bodythree treasures. Although there are three treasures, they are an interpretation of the one reality. So we call this kind of interpretation, one bodythree treasures orittai sambo. Ittai: ichiis one anditaiis bodysambois three treasures.Ittai sambo.But within the social framework of culture we have Buddhist culture. That culture consists of Buddha and his teaching, and the priests monks or followers of Buddhism. So, this understanding of the Three Treasures in Japanese is calledjuji sambo. Jujiactually means culturalsambo.Existingsambois what exists in society or within a cultural framework. So, beautiful buildings and Buddhist art or Buddhas image are, perhaps, Buddha. Scriptures written in a beautiful design and literature are Dharma. Priests monks in robes are maybe sangha.The cultural Three Treasures are closely related to society. The Buddhist organization is also Sangha. So there are three ways of understanding the Three Treasures, but actually the three are not different. It is one and it is three. This is a very old way of oriental thinking, even before Buddha. Buddha applied this interpretation to our framework of teaching. I think Christianity has the idea of Trinity. This is the universal framework of religion. But in Buddhism there are many sects, so Buddhism does not combine many ways of understanding in one school.Each school is based on some particular understanding or standpoint. We do not take many standpoints in one school. We especially emphasize this in Japan, but this is not sectarianism. Once we take a standpoint, we should develop that standpoint through and through until we can understand various standpoints. At first, each way of understanding has its own insight. But if your understanding becomes deeper and deeper, you can understand other viewpoints at the same time. This is how we establish various schools in Buddhism.The Nichiren school takes the standpoint of Dharma. Dharma includes the other two, Buddha and Sangha. Their object of worship is theLotus Sutra, and they repeat,nam myo ho renge kyo. Myo ho ren ge kyois the title of theLotus Sutrain Japanese.The Shin School repeats Amida Buddhas name,Namu Amida Butsu. The Zen school repeats Buddhas name, but the emphasis is on Sangha. The Zen school is not so concerned about the intellectual viewpoint or understanding. So we just repeat the founders name and say,Namu Shakyamuni Butsu.When we sayNamu Shakyamuni Butsu, his scripture is included and his Sangha is also included and we are a part of the Sangha. Even though we members of the Sangha are not direct disciples of Buddha, we are the descendants of Buddha. We are successors of Buddha and because we emphasize the practice of attaining enlightenment as Buddha did, we naturally put emphasis also on Sangha. Through practice we build our character as Buddha did and thats why we repeat Shakyamuni Buddhas name. For us it is natural to repeat Shakyamuni Buddhas name rather than Amida Buddhas name or the name of a scripture. If you repeat the name of some scripture, you are liable to be bound by some teaching which was told by Buddha. Actually, its impossible to authorize some teaching as the absolute teaching because something which is told by some particular person could not be absolute, even though it was told by Buddha. It may be impossible to authorize the teaching for human beings.You may say if its impossible to authorize even the teaching of Buddha, then how is it possible to authorize some person as a Buddha laughs. This is the point we are studying. This is why we emphasize our practice, and we have a particular understanding of practice called practice based on original enlightenment. It may look like quite an unusual way to authorize Buddhas Sangha, but this is more adequate and understandable. So Soto Zen emphasizes transmission from Buddha to us, and we emphasize Sangha or those who have transmission and who are disciples of Buddha.Up to now I have talked about the three ways of understanding the Three Treasures. The first is the Manifested Three Treasures. The next is One Body Three Treasures, or a philosophical understanding of the oneness of the Three Treasures. It is necessary to be concentrated on one thing. If we have three objects of worship, it is difficult to be concentrated so we have to have some philosophical or intellectual understanding. But, in fact, what exists here is the actual activity of Buddha. Therefore we emphasize the Sangha.The third way of understanding the Three Treasures is understanding our daily activity. This is the traditional Three Treasures or Cultural Three Treasures. But the Cultural Three Treasures are supported by philosophy and Buddhas teaching and Buddhas character, and the Cultural Three Treasures cannot be separated from the other two. When understanding the Three Treasures, each way will complement the other two and make our understanding complete. This is the Soto way of understanding the Three Treasures. We have the Three Treasures and what we do is practice zazen that is our way. So, our understanding of practice is very different from that of other schools.Each school has its own particular understanding of the Three Treasures. If you study each schools understanding of the Three Treasures, you will have perfect understanding. And you will find that even though there are many schools, what each one actually means is the same. It must be so because religious life is the expression of our inmost nature which is universal to everyone. As Buddha attained enlightenment, we will attain enlightenment. What Buddha was striving for is the same thing we are striving for because we have the same inmost nature as a human being.When you project your inmost nature into the objective world as Buddha, Dharma or Sangha, it is nothing but our inmost desire to be someone whom you can accept. You strive for something acceptable in its true sense. It is the same thing. You create God, and you strive for God. It means you are striving for yourself. And as we have the same human nature, our understanding of it must be the same. But if the standpoint is different, the way of explanation should be different, thats all.Tentatively, I am giving you an explanation of the Three Treasures. It may be necessary to explain it more, but as we have no time, I will explain the next paragraph.We should revere the Three Treasures and make offerings to them. Veneration of the Buddha, the Law or Truth, and the Sangha is in accordance with a precept handed down by Buddha in India to the ancestors of China. These are the most important precepts handed down from Buddha to us. We should not worship a Genie of the mountains, or call upon the spirit of death for any reason whatsoever, nor should we pay homage to any heretical religion or religious edifice. Such worship does not lead to emancipation. The Three Treasures are not just an idea invented by someone. They are the universal framework of all the advanced religions, not just the framework of the Buddhist religion. But some hasty person, who usually does not pay any attention to religion, finding himself in some difficulty, may worship something like the god of fire, or god of water or some powerful natural spirit without any idea of what the teaching is, what God is, or true practice.It is quite easy to know our inmost nature if it is related to the right way. And if we express that inmost nature in an appropriate way, it will develop. But if our inmost nature is misled by a hasty idea, a person may go astray and even destroy himself. This is why Buddha said that you should not worship the Genie of the mountains or call upon the spirit of death for any reason whatsoever. This is too simple.Nor should we pay homage to any heretical...here it says heretical, but heretical is not an adequate translation. I dont know if you have an appropriate word for this. We saygedo.Gedois outer way which is just a classification. We call Buddhist scripture inner scripture, and other, nonBuddhist literature outer. Whether inner or outer, it is the same thing inside and outside. Outside does not mean bad, and inside is not always good. So, as Buddhists, we should not take absolute refuge in outer religious scriptures or organizations. It is not because they are bad, but because we should not mix up our viewpoint. If you try to discover something good, like a monkey in a cage, you will not find out anything. All you will find is radishes. And your stomach will be hurt laugh. That is not our way. We should make some human effort always. That is why he says we should not pay homage to outer religious edifices. Such worship does not lead to emancipation. If we have only an idea of the Three Treasures, the Three Treasures will be the goal. If you just have an idea of God without a teaching of the way to God, you will be lost. You will be discouraged. If there is a God, there should be a way to God. But God is the absolute one. So it is a perpetual idea we have which cannot be attained. This point should be understood by people.It is necessary to have some way to enjoy Buddhahood. Someone who enjoys or rejoices in Buddha nature is the perfect one, or Buddha. This kind of framework is very important. And there must be some practice. There must be some understanding of life. For us, our everyday life is practice itself. So in our everyday life we have religion, if you understand Buddhism. Of course, you will reach Buddhahood through your activity in everyday life. But if you worship some god just because of fear, in what way can you appeal to your inmost request You will be lost. You will not be led to emancipation.Before Buddhism became popular in Japan, Prince Shotaku set up our Constitution for the Japanese people. In the second chapter he said, Respect the Three Treasures. He said that to follow the Three Treasures is the supreme way of attaining liberation for everyone. Because we use the terminology of Buddhism, it looks like what we are talking about is just Buddhism, but it is not actually so. That is why he said that if you worship some immature religion you will not attain enlightenment. To take refuge in the Triple Treasure it is necessary to have a pure faith. Whether it be at the time of the Tathagata or after his disappearance from the world, we should repeat his formula with clasped hands and bowed head, I take refuge in the Buddha. I take refuge in the Dharma. I take refuge in the Sangha.Pure faith includes our mental, physical and verbal effort. It is not enough to just think something or say something superficial. Pure faith means, not just faith in something, but real action reality, realized action. This is necessary to have real practice. You should take refuge in the Triple Treasure with real effort, not false effort. And it doesnt matter whether it is in the time of the Buddha Tathagata or not. In Zen Master Dogens time, almost everyone believed in the Three Periods of Buddhism. They said that in the last period people will not believe in Buddha and Buddhism will fade away into some other religion. But Dogen did not believe this. He believed that there is no difference in our practice, whether Buddha is here or not.We take refuge in the Buddha because he is the great teacher. We take refuge in the Law because it is our medicine and points the way. We take refuge in the Sangha because the members are our wise friends. Although the Three Treasures are one, the understanding, or the way they help us is different. It is through this triple adoration that we become the disciples of Buddha. Without the Triple Treasure, or if one of them is missing, we cannot be a disciple of the Buddha. It is on the basis of this adoration that all the moral precepts of Buddhism rest.We say adoration, but just to adore Buddha is like a dream. It means nothing. So adoration should follow some actual practice or guidance. Without guidance, God means nothing. Even though you believe in a God, it will not help you if your everyday life is cut off from God. In that way God means nothing. So all the great religions have their teachings and followers. And where there are followers, there should be a way to attain enlightenment not in the next life, but in this moment. This is Buddhism.Sincere Practice and Way Seeking MindTo take refuge in the Triple Treasure it is necessary to have pure faith, whether it be in the time of the Tathagata or after his disappearance from the world. We should repeat this formula with clasped hands and bowed head. .. Suzukis translation is, I take refuge in the Buddha, the incomparable honored one. I take refuge in the Dharma, honorable for its purity. I take refuge in the Sangha, honorable for its harmonious life. I have finished taking refuge in the Buddha. I have finished taking refuge in the Dharma. I have finished taking refuge in the Sangha.In Japanese it is simpler:namu kie Butsu, namu kie Ho, namu kie So. Kie Butsu myo sam, kie Ho rijin sam, kie So wago som kie bu kyo, kie Ho kyo, kie So kyo.But if we translate it into English, we cannot arrange the words in this way. Whether in English or Japanese, we have to repeat those precepts. Buddha is said to be the supreme world honored one. There are many names for him. We have ten names for Buddha. By Buddha we do not mean just Shakyamuni Buddha. At the same time we mean various Buddhas. So sometimes we say the Buddhas in the three periods of time: past, future and present.Namu sanze sho Butsu,we say: I take refuge in all Buddhas in the three worlds,Namuis to take refuge.Sanzemeans the three worlds.Shobutsumeans all the Buddhas, or we say,Ji ho san shi i shi hu. Ji homeans ten directions.San shimeans three worlds.I shimeans all.Humeans Buddha.Ji ho san shi i shi hu, shi son bu sa mo ko sameans:Shi sanis the supreme one,bu saisBosatsu, thatsbodhisattva. Mo ko sais great Bodhisattvas. That is actually Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. Dharma ismo ko ho ja ho ro mi. Mokoismahaormoka: great.Ho ja ho ro miisPrajna Paramita. That is the teaching. So when we sayji ho san shi i shi hu, shi son bu sa mo ko sa, mo ko ho ja ho ro mi,that means that we are taking refuge in Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. That is why we say:Ji ho san shi i shi hu. That is the old Chinese pronunciation, but the meaning is the same.The Buddha is supposed to be the Supreme One. The Dharma is called Dharma because it is Truth itself. It is impersonal so it is pure. There is no dust on it laughing. If there is any dust on the law, you will be put in jail, rules or Dharma should always be clean. So Dharma is something which is honored for its purity. I take refuge in the Sangha which is honored for its harmonious life.You know, we human beings should be always harmonious and we should work in unity. So we call a Buddhist group harmonious Sangha. Sangha meansSangorso gyain Japanese.Someans priest andgais plural sosanghameans priest group, or group of followers.Here he says, We take refuge in the Buddha because he is the great teacher. We take refuge in the Law because it is our medicine and points the way. It is law or rule. We take refuge in the priesthood because its members are our wise friends. It is through this triple adoration that we become disciples of Buddha. We should respect the Three Treasures before we receive any further precepts. This is the fundamental precept, since it is on the basis of this devotion that all the moral precepts of Buddhism rest, from beginning to end. Buddhism starts from these three refuges and ends with these three refuges.A responsive communication between the refugee and the preceptor makes the maturity of the merit of the triple refuges. Responsive communication is the translation ofkanno doko.This is a very difficult word to translate.Kannomeans to respond to each other. AndDokomeans true relationship.Dois Tao.Kois interrelationship. Here we sayKanno Doko. In terms of consciousness it happens in this way to us: we feel some coherence, or interrelationship, or correspondence between Buddha and us. But, originally, there is no difference between Buddha nature and human nature. So this is more than responsive communication or relationship. But it happens in this way, so a responsive communion between the refugee and the preceptor, or protector not protector, ok, maybe Buddha marks the maturity of the merit of the Triple Treasure.When we become one with Buddha, it means the Triple Treasure, or refuge, is completed. So, to take refuge in Buddha means to become one with Buddha or to find our true nature which is not different from Buddha. Be he a devil or man, dwelling in the lower regions, demon or animal whoever experiences the responsive communion is sure to take refuge in the Triple Treasure. By nature, everything has Buddha nature. So when beings have this experience, they can attain the perfection and they can take the Triple Treasure. The merit of having taken the Three Refuges continually increases through the various stages of existence and ultimately calls forth the highest right universal enlightenment. Highest right universal enlightenment is Buddhahood. If you repeat this experience, you will attain the highest Buddhahood. This excellent and inconceivably deep merit has been proved by the Tathagata himself therefore, all living beings should take this refuge.Buddha himself experienced it and Buddha has the same nature that we have. This means it is possible to have the same experience.This is not some particular experience when we realize our true nature or some occasion. So here we emphasize the universality of the Three Refuges. Here he just emphasizes the precepts, but precepts and Zen are not different. Both Zen and precepts are the expression of our true nature the experience of finding or realizing our true nature. In this sense there is no difference. So the way to practice Zen is the way we take refuge in the precepts.So, by mutual communion, orkanno doko, we mean the true experience of Zen. It is not some ecstasy or some mysterious state of mind, but it is a deep joy that is even more than joy. You may have this true experience through some change in your mental state. But a change of mental state is not, strictly speaking, enlightenment. Enlightenment is more than that. That comes with it, but it is more than that. What we experience is joy or mysterious experience, but something follows. That something which follows, besides this experience, is true enlightenment. So we should not suppose that enlightenment will always be experienced in terms of consciousness. Even though you dont know, you know that enlightenment is there. And by repeating various activities with this subtle caution, the experience becomes deeper and your consciousness will become more and more mature and smooth. So you may say that enlightenment is the maturity of your experience of everyday life. When enlightenment does not follow, your experience is black and white. But when true experience follows your conscious activity or conscious experience, the way you accept it is more natural, smooth, and deep.It is not just joy. It is something more than joy. It may not be possible to experience enlightenment just in terms of consciousness. But what you do experience is much deeper. This point should always be remembered. If you remember this point, all the precepts are there. You will not be attached to some particular experience you will not be caught by the dualistic experience of good or bad, or myself or others. When we violate the precepts, we attach to some particular experience.When you have something, you will have some joy of possession. To do that is, you know, to break the precept of not stealing, laughs or not being greedy about giving either spiritual or material help to others. So when those three precepts are kept in the right way, all the precepts will be kept. In short, when you do everything as you do zazen, then all the precepts will be there. We say that we have to just sit. Our mind is clear. You have no experience whatsoever. Maybe the only experience you will have is sleepiness or pain in your legs laughs. No particular experience.But when you attain enlightenment, when some sudden change of mental state comes to you happens to you even that experience is not true enlightenment. You will see something, or realize something in terms of consciousness, but that means you saw something, thats all. It may not be yours. You saw something there, something beautiful. That is the experience, thats all. It is a true experience, but that is not enough. We should obtain the truth. We should become one with the truth. That is taking refuge in Buddha or Truth. When we become one with it, there is no communion or interrelationship because it is just one. That is completely taking refuge in its true sense. That is the experience we have in our practice.Namuin Japanese means to plunge into something. We say, you cannot skim over the water in a basket. But if you dip the basket in it, the basket will be full of water. That is the way. As long as you are making laughter a dualistic effort, you cannot do anything because you are a basket. You are full of holes. Holes are you. We say,mu ro chi. Mu ro chimeans nohole wisdom. laughter Our wisdom is hole wisdom. Wisdom with holes.Mu ro chimeans noholes wisdom. But for us, no holes wisdom is just dipping a basket in the water. Then there is no hole. laughter That is taking refuge, and that is how we practice zazen. This is the interpretation of precepts and the understanding of our zazen.Thank you very much.Right Effort in PracticeAll the difficulties you have in zazen should not take place outside your mind. Your efforts should be kept within your mind. In other words you have to accept the difficulty as not being other than what you are.Most of you are beginners, so it may be rather difficult for you to understand why we practice zazen or meditation in this way. We always say justtosit. And if you do, you will find out that Zen practice, or justtosit, is not easy. Justtosit may be the most difficult thing. To work on something is not difficult how to not work on anything is rather difficult. When we have the idea of self, we want some reason why we work on something. But if you do not have the idea of self, you can remain silent and calm whether or not you work on something. You will not lose your composure. So to remain silent and calm is a kind of test we receive. If you can do it, it means you have no idea of self. If your life is based on the usual idea of self, what you will do will not be successful in its true sense. There will be success in one way, but in another you are digging your own grave. So to work without the idea of self, is a very, very important point. It is much more important than making a good decision. Even a good decision based on a onesided idea of self will create difficulties for yourself and others.For students of Zen, to work on something or to help others is to do things with our single mind. Our effort is concentrated within ourselves. This is the activity of our essence of mind, according to the Sixth Patriarch who said that in the realm of our essence of mind, we do not do things outside of mind. All that we do is the activity of our essence of mind which is not dualistic. By essence of mind he means Big Mind and not the selfish mind. Of course, there is dualistic activity, but it takes place within Big Mind. This kind of singleminded activity is distinguished from ordinary dualistic activity.When you practice zazen, you will of course have physical pain in your legs and mentally you will have some difficulty. You will find it difficult to be concentrated on your breathing. One after another images will come into your mind. Or your mind will go out for a walk and wander about. I have many difficulties in my practice, so I think you, too, will find it very difficult to sit in good zazen.All the difficulties you have in zazen should not take place outside your mind. Your efforts should be kept within your mind. In other words you have to accept the difficulty as not being other than what you are. You should not try to make some tentative particular effort based on your small mind like, my practice should be better. My practice you say, but zazen is not your practice, it is buddhas practice. Your effort is based on Big Mind which cannot get out of. If your small self begins to act without the care of Big Mind, that is not Zen. What you do should be well taken care of by Big Mind. Our practice should be based on mind or original wayseeking mind which works on and on continuously.The secret of practice is also true in observation of Buddhist precepts. The dualistic idea of whether to observe or not observe the precepts takes place within your mind when you practice Zen. There are no precepts to break and there is no one who is violating the precepts. To make up your mind to make the very best effort to observe the precepts constantly, forever, whether your effort is complete or not, is Buddhas BuddhaMinds effort. But if you put yourself outside the precepts or outside BuddhaMind then there is no time to observe them completely. If your activity is involved in Buddhas activity, whatever you do is Buddhas effort. The even if it is not perfect, you are manifesting Buddhas mercy and activity.Dogen Zenji was enlightened when he heard his master strike and say to the disciple sitting next to Dogen, What are you doing You have to make a hard effort. What are you doing That effort is Zen. That effort is to observe the precepts. If we make our best effort on each moment with confidence, that is enlightenment. When you ask whether your way is perfect or not, there is an insidious idea of self. When you do your best to observe the precepts, to practice Zen, within the Big Mind then there is enlightenment. There is no special way to attain enlightenment. Enlightenment is not some certain stage. Enlightenment is everywhere. Wherever you are, enlightenment is there. Whatever you do with your best effort, enlightenment follows. This is very important for our Zen practice and for our everyday life. We should make our best effort in our everyday life as well as in practice of Zen.In order to have this kind of practice in everyday life, you want your friend, you want your master, you want the precepts we have. Some form is necessary because it is not possible to be concentrated on an uncertain way. There must be strict rules to observe. Because of the rules, of the way of sitting, of the way of practice, it is possible to be concentrated. It is the same thing in your everyday life. Without purpose or aim you cannot organize your life.My master Ian Kishizawa Roshi used to say that we had to have a vow or an aim to accomplish. The aim we have may not be prefect in its strict sense, but even so it is necessary for us to have it. It is like the precepts. Even though it is almost impossible to observe them, we must have them. Without an aim in our life and the precepts, we cannot be a good Buddhist, we cannot actualize our way.We should be very grateful to the rigid formal way of practicing Zen and Zen precepts. You may think these precepts are useless if we cannot observe them perfectly. But they are the traces of human efforts based on the great mercy of Buddha. The life we have now is the result of such useless effort. From onecelled animals to monkeys. I do not know how long, but we wasted much time, many efforts until we came to this human life. The giant redwood trees of Muir Woods have annual rings or layers and we have these annual layers in our human life too, I think. That is precepts in its wide sense. You say we dont want them, but you have them. As long as you do, you should sit, and thus you have to know how to continue your effort to have another annual ring. In this way we will develop Buddhism more and more, forever.Strictly speaking we must have more precepts in America. You think twohundred and fifty precepts for men and five hundred for women is awful and that it should be made simpler. But I think you have to add some more to the precepts we have in Japan. Actually, I think you will have more difficulty in practicing zazen in America than we do in Japan. This kind of difficulty should be continued forever or we will not have peace in our world. Without the precepts there can be no congenial life for human beings. By reflecting on our human life and by respecting the precepts and rules of humanity, we will know the direction in which to make effort and we will have the right orientation in our life. This is how we practice Zen and how Buddhism has been developed.Zazen, Rituals Precepts Cannot Be SeparatedI want to talk with you about some problems you may have when you come to Zen Center. I think you understand pretty well why we practice. Why we observe rituals is perhaps more difficult to understand. If you ask me why I observe rituals, it is difficult to answer.First, I do it because I have been doing it for a long time so there is no problem. I tend to think that because I have no problem in observing my way, then you must not have a problem laughs. But you are Americans, and I am Japanese, and you have not been practicing the Buddhist way for so long, therefore there must be various problems laughs.These problems are almost impossible to solve. But if you actually follow our way I think you will have some understanding of our rituals. What I want to talk about is the precepts.Precepts for me includes rituals. And when we say precepts, it is another name for our zazen practice. For us, zazen practice and observation of rituals are not two different things. How to observe the rituals is how to observe the precepts. Our practice, especially in the Soto school, puts emphasis on everyday life, including rituals, eating, and going to the restroom. All those things are included in our practice.So the way we practice zazen, the way we practice rituals, and the way of life of a Buddhist or Zen student is all fundamentally the same. But when we talk about our way of life or rituals, we come face to face with some rules. The rules of observing ceremonies are rituals, and the rules of our everyday life are our precepts. When we say precepts, we usually mean some rules, but that is just a superficial understanding of precepts. Precepts are actually the expression of our true nature. The way we express our true nature is always according to the place or situation in which you live. So to practice zazen is to be yourself and to observe our precepts is just to be yourself.As you have some way of sitting on a black cushion, we have some way of observing our rituals or ceremony in the Buddha Hall. The point of our zazen practice is to be free from thinking mind and from emotional activity. In short, that is the practice of selflessness. In our observation of rituals, the point is to be free from selfish ideas. The practice of rituals is the practice of selflessness.First you enter the room and you bow. In Japanese we saygotai tochi.Gotaiis our body.Tochiis to throw away. It means to throw away our physical and mental beingin short, to practice selflessness. We offer ourselves to Buddha. That is the practice of bowing. When you bow to the floor, you lift your hands. We lift Buddhas feet, which are on your palms and you feel Buddha on your palms. So when you practice bowing, you have no idea of self. You give up everything.When Buddha was begging, his follower spread his hair on the muddy ground and let Buddha walk over it. That is supposed to be the origin of why we bow. In ritual, you bow and work. You begin everything by some signal. That kind of thing you may not like so much laughs. It looks very formal, to begin everything by the sound of a bell. Whether you want to do it or not, you must do it. It looks very formal. As long as you are in the Buddha Hall, you should observe our way according to the rules we have there. We do it to forget ourselves and to become one. To be a Zen student in this Buddha Hall is why we observe our rituals.This is a very important point. To feel your being, here, in this moment, is a very important practice. That is the point of observing precepts and observing rituals and practicing zazen. To feel or to be yourself at a certain time, in a certain place. That is why we practice our way.So the actual feeling of rituals cannot be understood without observing them. When you observe them, you have the actual feeling of rituals. As long as you try to know what it means or why you do it, it is difficult to feel your actual being in this place. Only when you do it will you feel your being. To be a Buddhist is to do things like Buddha. That is actually how to be a Buddhist. It does not mean that when you are able to observe our rituals as your friends do, that you will have no problem in your everyday life. This ritual feeling, or practice, will extend into your everyday life.You will find yourself in various situations, and you will intuitively know what you should do. You will have the right response to someones activity. When you are not able to respond to another without wondering what he has on his mind, you will force something. Most of the time I dont think you will give the most intuitive response.I want you to do rituals until you are quite sure about your response to other people. How one responds to others is very important. When we teachers observe our students, they may be trying to act right, and trying to understand people, but most of the time it is rather difficult for them to have some kind of intuition. If you start to have this kind of intuition, you will have big confidence in yourself, and you will trust people, and you will trust yourself. And so, all the problems which you created for yourself will be no more. You will have no more problem. That is why we have training or practice.My master, Gyokujun Soon, used to say, Stay with me for several years. If you become a priest, you will be a good priest, and if you remain a layman, you will be a good layman or good citizen, and you will have no problem in your life.I think that was very true. I was the sixth and youngest disciple when I became my masters disciple. Two of us became priests, the rest of the disciples remained laymen. They are very good actually. When they came to my teacher laughs, they had some trouble. Except for one disciple who passed away, the rest of them have done pretty well, although they are not priests. So I think what he said is very true.This is very good practice for you. You may think our practice is like army practice laughs, but actually it is not so. The idea is quite different. I think the Japanese army copied our practice. It looks like it, but they couldnt copy our spirit.You should trust your innate nature, your buddhanature. That is the most important point. If you trust your true nature, you should be able to trust your teacher, too. That is very important. Not because your teacher is perfect, but because his innate nature is the same as yours. The point of practice between teacher and disciple is to get rid of selfish ideas as much as possible and to trust each other. Only when you trust your teacher can you practice zazen, can you practice rituals, and can you act as a Zen Center student.To remain always a Zen Center student is a very important point. You become a Zen Center student by trusting your true nature, and trusting your teacher, and trusting your zazen practice without saying why laughs. I think you should do it, as long as you come here. And if you dont want to do so, I think you shouldnt come here. As long as you come here, you should follow our way, or else maybe you will waste your time and you will regret it.So in this way, we can carry on our schedule. The way we carry on our schedule is the way we observe our precepts. Precepts were initiated by Buddha when he said, Dont do this, or dont behave like that. That was the origin of precepts. In India, in Buddhas time, there were Buddhas precepts. And in China, they have precepts which are based on the Chinese way of life. We have sixteen precepts, and these precepts are the essential precepts which we should observe as a Japanese, as an American, or as an Indian priest or layman.These precepts are the precepts which you can apply to your everyday life. We say, Dont kill, but dont kill does not just mean dont kill flies or insects. Actually, it is too late. If you say, Here is a fly, should I kill it or not it is too late! Before we see the fly, we have this kind of problem. When we eat, we say, Seventytwo labors brought us this rice. When we say seventytwo labors this includes protecting grains from various insects. It is not justnot to kill insects. When you eat, and you chant, Seventytwo labors brought us this rice, it includes already the precept of not to kill. After making a great effort to protect the corn from insects, we can eat. When you chant, seventytwo labors, you should be relating to the precept not to kill. So not to kill, is not any special precept.To exist here in this way is the result of sacrificing many animals and plants. You are always sacrificing something. So as long as you are involved in dualistic concepts, it is not possible for you to observe our precepts. So how to get out of dualistic concepts and fill our being with gratitude is the point of practice. Actually it is very foolish to say not to kill. But the reason we say not to kill is to point out or to understand our life from various angles. Not to kill, not to steal, not to speak ill of others. Each of these precepts includes the other precepts. And each practice or ritual we observe includes the others. So if you have the actual feeling of being here, that is the way to observe precepts and the way to practice zazen.If you understand how you observe even one precept, you can observe the rest of the precepts and you can practice zazen, you can observe rituals. Zazen practice and observation of rituals or precepts cannot be separated. How to experience this kind of feeling is how you understand our precepts.If you say it is difficult, it may be very difficult. But it will not be so difficult a thing if you say, I will do it. That is how you observe precepts, even without thinking whether you can observe them or not. I will do it means dont kill animals. You may say so, because originally it is not possible to kill anything. You think you killed, but actually, you cannot. Even though you think you killed, they are still alive laughs. Even though you eat something, it is still alive in your body. If something leaves your body, it is still alive.It is not possible for anything to be killed. The only way is to be grateful for everything you have. That is how we keep our precepts without having a dualistic understanding of precepts.Then you may say, If so, there will not be any need to have precepts. But unless you are sure, you cannot feel your presence or your being. You do not feel you are alive. You do not have the joy of life or gratitude for everything. You can easily say, No, I wouldnt kill anything. But it means that you will not sacrifice yourself for anything. You will be just you. You will not be caught by a dualistic understanding of yourself, and you will feel yourself, as you feel yourself in zazen.It is rather difficult to explain, but that is actually how we observe precepts. Dogen Zenji said, Even though we do not try to observe precepts, like a scarecrow laughs more evil comes to you. It is strange, when you feel your being in its true sense right here, no evil comes. You cannot violate any precepts, and whatever you do, that is the expression of your true nature. You will not say, I shouldnt say that, or I shouldnt do that. You will be quite free from that kind of regret or arrogance of observing some special precepts. That is how to observe precepts.To repeat, precepts are chewing your brown rice laughs. Without chewing your brown rice, you cannot eat it. Only when you chew it for a pretty long time will you appreciate the taste of brown rice. When you say, Oh this is awful! Laughs how many times should I chew it before I swallow it down that is a very foolish way of eating brown rice. If you say, Oh, sixteen precepts! Awful to be a Buddhist! laughter Then you have no chance to have a real taste of the Buddhist way. If you observe them one by one, that is how you chew brown rice and how you practice our way.\""

       "'During my entire research life, friends and curious people have asked me to explain what was going on in quantum gravity research. How was it possible to study new ways of thinking about space and time Over and over again I have been asked to write a popular account of this research. While books on cosmology or string theory abound, a book describing the research on the quantum nature of space and time, and on loop quantum gravity in particular, did not yet exist. I have long hesitated, because I wanted to concentrate on research. Some years ago, after completing my technical book on the subject, I felt that the collective work of many scientists had moved the topic to a stage mature enough for a popular book. The landscape we are exploring is enchanting: why keep it hiddenBut I still delayed the project, because I could not see the book in my head. How to explain a world without space and time One night in , during a long solitary drive from Italy to France, I realized that the only way to explain in a comprehensible manner the ongoing modifications of the notions of space and time was to tell the story from the beginning: starting from Democritus, all the way through to the quanta of space. After all, this is how I understand the story. I began to design the entire book in my mind while driving, and got increasingly excited, until I heard a police cars sirens telling me to pull over: I was driving far above the speed limit. The Italian policemen asked me politely if I was crazy to drive at that speed. I explained that I had just found the idea Id been seeking for so long the policeman let me go without a ticket, and wished me good luck with the book. This is the book.This book was written and first published in Italian at the beginning of . Shortly afterwards, I wrote a few articles on fundamental physics for an Italian newspaper. A prestigious Italian publisher, Adelphi, asked me for an extended version of these articles, to appear as a small booklet. This is the origin of the short book Seven Brief Lessons on Physics, which to my immense surprise has become an international bestseller and has opened a beautiful channel of communication between me and so many wonderful readers all over the world. The Seven Lessons were thus written after this book, and to some extent they are a synthesis of some of the topics you find here. If you have read Seven Brief Lessons on Physics and want to know more, to journey deeper into the strange world that book sketched, here you can find more.While the account of established physics I give here is presented from the peculiar perspective in which I understand it, it is largely uncontroversial. However, the part of this book that describes current research in quantum gravity is my own personal understanding of the state of the art. This is the region at the boundary between what we have understood and what we do not yet understand, and is still far from achieving consensus. Some of my physicist colleagues will agree with what I write here others wont. This is true for all presentations of ongoing research at the frontiers of knowledge, but I prefer to state it upfront and clearly. This is not a book about certainties: it is a book about the adventure of moving towards the unknown.As a whole, this is a travel book describing one of the most spectacular journeys that humanity has taken: a journey out of our limited and parochial views of reality, towards an increasingly vast understanding of the structure of things. A magical journey out of our commonsense view of things, far from complete.Marseille, May Preface: Walking along the ShoreWe are obsessed with ourselves. We study our history, our psychology, our philosophy, our gods. Much of our knowledge revolves around man himself, as if we were the most important thing in the universe. I think I like physics because it opens a window through which we can see further. It gives me the sense of fresh air entering the house.What we see out there through the window is constantly surprising us. We have learned a great deal about the universe. In the course of the centuries we have come to realize just how very many wrong ideas we had. We thought that the Earth was flat, and that it was the still centre of our world. That the universe was small, and unchanging. We believed that man was a breed apart, without kinship to the other animals. We have learned of the existence of quarks, black holes, particles of light, waves of space, and of the extraordinary molecular structures in every cell of our bodies. The human race is like a growing child who discovers with amazement that the world consists not just of his bedroom and playground, but that it is vast, and that there are a thousand things to discover, and innumerable ideas quite different from those with which he began. The universe is multiform and boundless, and we continue to stumble upon new aspects of it. The more we learn about the world, the more we are amazed by its variety, beauty and simplicity.But the more we discover, the more we understand that what we dont yet know is greater than what we know. The more powerful our telescopes, the stranger and more unexpected are the heavens we see. The closer we look at the minute detail of matter, the more we discover of its profound structure. Today we see almost to the Big Bang, the great explosion from which, billion years ago, all the galaxies were born but we have already begun to glimpse something beyond the Big Bang. We have learned that space is curved, but already foresee that this same space is woven from vibrating quantum grains.Our knowledge of the elementary grammar of the world continues to grow. If we try to put together what we have learned about the physical world in the course of the twentieth century, the clues point towards something profoundly different from what we were taught at school. An elementary structure of the world is emerging, generated by a swarm of quantum events, where time and space do not exist. Quantum fields draw space, time, matter and light, exchanging information between one event and another. Reality is a network of granular events the dynamic which connects them is probabilistic between one event and another, space, time, matter and energy melt in a cloud of probability.This strange new world is slowly emerging today from the study of the main open question posed in fundamental physics: quantum gravity. Its the problem of coherently synthesizing what we have learned about the world with the two major discoveries of twentiethcentury physics: general relativity and quantum theory. To quantum gravity, and the strange world that this research is unfolding, this book is dedicated.The book is a live coverage of the ongoing research: what we are learning, what we already know, and what we think we are beginning to understand, about the elementary nature of things. It starts from the distant origin of some key ideas that we use today to order our understanding of the world and describes the two great discoveries of the twentieth century Einsteins general relativity and quantum mechanics trying to put into focus the core of their physical content. It tells of the picture of the world which is emerging today from research in quantum gravity, taking into account the latest indications given by nature, such as the confirmation of the cosmological standard model obtained from the Planck satellite and the failure at N to observe the supersymmetric particles that many expected. And it discusses the consequences of these ideas: the granular structure of space the disappearance of time at small scale the physics of the Big Bang the origin of blackhole heat up to the role of information in the foundation of physics.In a famous myth related by Plato in the seventh book of The Republic, some men are chained at the bottom of a dark cave and see only shadows cast upon a wall by a fire behind them. They think that this is reality. One of them frees himself, leaves the cave and discovers the light of the Sun, and the wider world. At first the light, to which his eyes are unaccustomed, stuns and confuses him. But eventually he can see, and returns excitedly to his companions to tell them what he has seen. They find it hard to believe.We are all in the depths of a cave, chained by our ignorance, by our prejudices, and our weak senses reveal to us only shadows. If we try to see further, we are confused: we are unaccustomed. But we try. This is science. Scientific thinking explores and redraws the world, gradually offering us better and better images of it, teaching us to think in ever more effective ways. Science is a continual exploration of ways of thinking. Its strength is its visionary capacity to demolish preconceived ideas, to reveal new regions of reality, and to construct novel and more effective images of the world. This adventure rests upon the entirety of past knowledge, but at its heart is change. The world is boundless and iridescent we want to go and see it. We are immersed in its mystery and in its beauty, and over the horizon there is unexplored territory. The incompleteness and the uncertainty of our knowledge, our precariousness, suspended over the abyss of the immensity of what we dont know, does not render life meaningless: it makes it interesting and precious.I have written this book to give an account of what for me is the wonder of this adventure. Ive written with a particular reader in mind: someone who knows little or nothing about todays physics but is curious to find out what we know, but also what we dont yet understand, about the elementary weave of the world and where we are searching. And I have written it to try to communicate the breathtaking beauty of the panorama of reality which can be seen from this perspective.Ive also written it for my colleagues, fellow travellers dispersed throughout the world, as well as for the young women and men with a passion for science, eager to set out on this journey for the first time. Ive sought to outline the general landscape of the structure of the physical world, as seen by the double lights of relativity and of quantum physics, and to show how they can be combined. This is not only a book of divulgation its also one which articulates a point of view, in a field of research where the abstraction of the technical language may sometimes obscure the wideangle vision. Science is made up of experiments, hypotheses, equations, calculations and long discussions but these are only tools, like the instruments of musicians. In the end, what matters in music is the music itself, and what matters in science is the understanding of the world which science provides. To understand the significance of the discovery that the Earth turns around the Sun, it is not necessary to follow Copernicuss complicated calculations to understand the importance of the discovery that all living beings on our planet have the same ancestors, it is not necessary to follow the complex arguments of Darwins books. Science is about reading the world from a gradually widening point of view.This book gives an account of the current state of the search for our new image of the world, as I understand it today. It is the reply I would give to a colleague and friend asking me, So, what do you think is the true nature of things, as we walk along the shore, on a long midsummers evening.Part One This book begins in Miletus, twentysix centuries ago. Why begin a book about quantum gravity with events, people and ideas so ancient I hope the reader eager to get on to quanta of space will not hold this against me. For it is easier to understand ideas by starting with the roots from which they have grown, and an important number of the ideas which turned out to be effective for understanding the world originated over two thousand years ago. If we briefly retrace their birth, they become clearer, and the later steps turn out to be simpler and natural.But theres more. Certain problems first posed in antiquity continue to be crucial to our understanding of the world. Some of the most recent ideas about the structure of space utilize concepts and issues introduced then. In speaking of these distant ideas, I put on to the table questions which are going to be central to quantum gravity. This makes it also possible, when treating of quantum gravity, to distinguish between the ideas which go back to the very origin of scientific thought, even if we are unfamiliar with them, and those which are radically new. The connection between problems posed by the scientists of antiquity, and solutions found by Einstein and quantum gravity, is, as we shall see, surprisingly close.. GrainsAccording to tradition, in the year , a man embarked upon a ship travelling from Miletus to Abdera. It was to be a crucial journey for the history of knowledge.The man was probably fleeing political turmoil in Miletus, where the aristocracy was violently seizing back power. Miletus had been a prosperous and flourishing Greek city, perhaps the principal city of the Greek world before the golden age of Athens and Sparta. It had been a busy commercial hub, dominating a network of almost a hundred colonies and commercial outposts, stretching from the Black Sea to Egypt. Caravans from Mesopotamia and ships from all over the Mediterranean arrived at Miletus, and ideas circulated.Figure . The journey made by Leucippus of Miletus, the founder of the atomist school circa .During the preceding century, a revolution in thinking which would prove fundamental to humanity had taken place in Miletus. A group of thinkers had reformulated the way questions were asked about the world, and the way answers were sought. The greatest of these thinkers was Anaximander.From time immemorial, or at least since humanity had left written texts which have come down to us, men had asked themselves how the world had come into being, what it was composed of, how it was ordered, and why natural phenomena occurred. For thousands of years they had given themselves answers which all resembled one another: answers which referred to elaborate stories of spirits, deities, imaginary and mythological creatures, and other similar things. From cuneiform tablets to ancient Chinese texts from hieroglyphic writing in the Pyramids to the myths of the Sioux from the most ancient Indian texts to the Bible from African stories to those of aboriginal Australians, it was all a colourful but basically quite monotonous flow of Plumed Serpents and Great Cows, of irascible, litigious, or kindly deities who create the world by breathing over abysses, uttering Fiat lux, or emerging out of a stone egg.Then, at Miletus, at the beginning of the fifth century before our era, Thales, his pupil Anaximander, Hecataeus and their school find a different way of looking for answers. This immense revolution in thought inaugurates a new mode of knowledge and understanding, and signals the first dawn of scientific thought.The Milesians understand that by shrewdly using observation and reason, rather than searching for answers in fantasy, ancient myths or religion and, above all, by using critical thought in a discriminating way it is possible to repeatedly correct our world view, and to discover new aspects of reality which are hidden to the common view. It is possible to discover the new.Perhaps the decisive discovery is that of a different style of thinking, where the disciple is no longer obliged to respect and share the ideas of the master but is free to build on those ideas without being afraid to discard or criticize the part that can be improved. This is a novel middle way, placed between full adherence to a school and generic deprecation of ideas. It is the key to the subsequent development of philosophical and scientific thinking: from this moment onwards, knowledge begins to grow at a vertiginous pace, nourished by past knowledge but at the same time by the possibility of criticism, and therefore of improving knowledge and understanding. The dazzling incipit of Hecataeuss book of history goes to the heart of this critical thinking, including as it does the awareness of our own fallibility: I wrote things which seem true to me, because the accounts of the Greeks seem to be full of contradictory and ridiculous things.According to legend, Heracles descended to Hades from Cape Tenaro. Hecataeus visits Cape Tenaro, and determines that there is in fact no subterranean passage or other access to Hades there and therefore judges the legend to be false. This marks the dawn of a new era.This new approach to knowledge works quickly and impressively. Within a matter of a few years, Anaximander understands that the Earth floats in the sky and the sky continues beneath the Earth that rainwater comes from the evaporation of water on Earth that the variety of substances in the world must be susceptible to being understood in terms of a single, unitary and simple constituent, which he calls apeiron, the indistinct that the animals and plants evolve and adapt to changes in the environment, and that man must have evolved from other animals. Thus, gradually, was founded the basis of a grammar for understanding the world which is substantially still our own today.Situated at a point of conjunction between the emergent Greek civilization and the ancient empires of Mesopotamia and Egypt, nourished by their knowledge but immersed in the liberty and the political fluidity which is typically Greek in a social space without imperial palaces, or powerful priestly castes, where individual citizens discuss their destinies in open agoras, Miletus is the place where, for the first time, men decide collectively their own laws where the first parliament in the history of the world gathers the Panionium, meetingplace of the delegates of the Ionian League and where for the first time men doubt that only the gods are capable of accounting for the mysteries of the world. Through discussion, it is possible to reach the best decisions for the community through discussion, it is possible to understand the world. This is the immense legacy of Miletus, cradle of philosophy, of the natural sciences, and of geographical and historical studies. It is no exaggeration to say that the entire scientific and philosophical tradition, Mediterranean and then modern, has a crucial root in the speculations of the thinkers of Miletus in the sixth century .This luminous Miletus shortly afterwards came to a calamitous end. The arrival of the Persian Empire, and a failed antiimperial revolt, led to a ferocious destruction of the city in E and to the enslavement of a large number of its inhabitants. In Athens, the poet Phrynichus writes the tragedy The Taking of Miletus, which so deeply moves the Athenians that its restaging is prohibited, on account of it causing too much distress. But twenty years later, the Greeks repel the Persian menace Miletus is reborn, repopulated, and returned to being a centre of commerce and ideas, radiating its thought and spirit once more.The person with whom we began this chapter must have been moved by this spirit when, in , according to tradition, he embarked from Miletus for Abdera. His name was Leucippus. Little is known about his life. He wrote a book entitled The Great Cosmology. On his arrival in Abdera, he founded a scientific and philosophical school to which he soon affiliated a young disciple, Democritus, whose long shadow was to be cast over the thought of all subsequent times.Together, these two thinkers have built the majestic cathedral of ancient atomism. Leucippus was the teacher. Democritus, the great pupil who wrote dozens of works on every field of knowledge, and was deeply venerated in antiquity, when people were familiar with these works. The most subtle of the Ancients, Seneca called him. Who is there whom we can compare with him for the greatness, not merely of his genius, but also of his spirit asks Cicero.What, then, had Leucippus and Democritus discovered The Milesians had understood that the world can be comprehended using reason. They had become convinced that the variety of natural phenomena must be attributable to something simple, and had tried to understand what this something might be. They had conceived of a kind of elementary substance of which everything was made. Anaximenes, among the Milesians, had imagined this substance could compress and rarefy, thus transforming from one to another of the elements of which the world is constituted. It was a first germ of physics, rough and elementary, but in the right direction. An idea was needed, a great idea, a grand vision, to grasp the hidden order of the world. Leucippus and Democritus came up with this idea.Figure . Democritus of Abdera.The idea of Democrituss system is extremely simple: the entire universe is made up of a boundless space in which innumerable atoms run. Space is without limits has neither an above nor a below is without a centre, or a boundary. Atoms have no qualities at all, apart from their shape. They have no weight, no colour, no taste. By convention is sweet, by convention bitter, by convention hot, by convention colour but by verity atoms and void.Atoms are indivisible they are the elementary grains of reality, which cannot be further subdivided, and everything is made of them. They move freely in space, colliding one with another they hook on to and push and pull each other. Similar atoms attract each other and join.This is the weave of the world. This is reality. Everything else is nothing but a byproduct, random and accidental, of this movement and this combining of atoms. The infinite variety of the substances of which the world is made derives solely from this combining of atoms.When atoms aggregate, the only thing that matters, the only thing that exists at the elementary level, is their shape, their arrangement, and the order in which they combine. Just as by combining the letters of the alphabet in different ways we may obtain comedies or tragedies, ridiculous stories or epic poems, so elementary atoms combine to produce the world in its endless variety. The metaphor is Democrituss own.There is no finality, no purpose, in this endless dance of atoms. We, just like the rest of the natural world, are one of the many products of this infinite dance. The product, that is, of an accidental combination. Nature continues to experiment with forms and structures and we, like the animals, are the products of a selection which is random and accidental, over the course of eons of time. Our life is a combination of atoms, our thoughts are made up of thin atoms, our dreams are the products of atoms our hopes and our emotions are written in a language formed by combinations of atoms the light which we see is comprised of atoms which bring us images. The seas are made of atoms, as are our cities, and the stars. Its an immense vision boundless, incredibly simple and incredibly powerful, one on which the knowledge of a civilization would later be built.On this foundation Democritus wrote dozens of books articulating a vast system, dealing with questions of physics, philosophy, ethics, politics and cosmology. He writes on the nature of language, on religion, on the origins of human societies, and on much else besides. The opening of his Little Cosmology is impressive: In this work I treat of all things. All of these books have been lost. We know of his thought only through the quotations and references made by other ancient authors, and by their summaries of his ideas. The thought which thus emerges is a kind of intense humanism, rationalist and materialist. Democritus combines a keen attention to nature, illuminated by a naturalistic clarity in which every residual system of mythic ideas is cleared away, with a great attention to humanity and a deep ethical concern for life anticipating by some two thousand years the best aspects of the eighteenthcentury Enlightenment. The ethical ideal of Democritus is that of a serenity of mind reached through moderation and balance, by trusting in reason and not allowing oneself to be overwhelmed by passions.Plato and Aristotle were familiar with Democrituss ideas, and fought against them. They did so on behalf of other ideas, some of which were later, for centuries, to create obstacles to the growth of knowledge. Both insisted on rejecting Democrituss naturalistic explanations, in favour of trying to understand the world in finalistic terms believing, that is, that everything that happens has a purpose a way of thinking that would reveal itself to be very misleading for understanding the ways of nature or in terms of good and evil, confusing human issues with matters which do not relate to us.Aristotle speaks extensively about the ideas of Democritus, and with respect. Plato never cites Democritus, but scholars suspect today that this was out of deliberate choice and not for lack of knowledge of his works. Criticism of Democrituss ideas is implicit in several of Platos texts, as in his critique of physicists, for example. In a passage in his Phaedo, Plato has Socrates articulate a reproach to all physicists which will have a lasting resonance. He complains that when physicists had explained that the Earth was round, he rebelled because he wanted to know what good it was for the Earth to be round how its roundness would benefit it. Platos Socrates recounts how he had at first been enthusiastic about physics, but had come to be disillusioned by it:I had expected to be first told that the Earth was flat or round, but also that, afterwards, the reason for the necessity of this shape would be explained to me, starting from the principle of the best, proving to me that the best thing for the Earth is to have this shape. And if he had said that the Earth was at the centre of the world, then to show me how being at the centre was of benefit to the Earth.How completely off track the great Plato was here!Is there a limit to divisibilityThe greatest physicist of the second half of the twentieth century, Richard Feynman, wrote at the beginning of his wonderful introductory lessons on physics:If, in some cataclysm, all scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generation of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words I believe it is the atomic hypothesis, or the atomic fact, or whatever you wish to call it, that all things are made of atoms little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. In that one sentence you will see an enormous amount of information about the world, if just a little imagination and thinking are applied.Without needing anything from modern physics, Democritus had already arrived at the idea that everything is made up of indivisible particles. How did he do itHe had arguments based upon observation for example, he imagined, correctly, that the wearing down of a wheel, or the drying of clothes on a line, could be due to the slow flight of particles of wood or of water. But he also had arguments of a philosophical kind. Lets focus on these, because their potency reaches all the way to quantum gravity.Democritus observed that matter could not be a continuous whole, because there is something contradictory in the proposition that it should be so. We know of Democrituss reasoning because Aristotle reports it. Imagine, says Democritus, that matter is infinitely divisible, that is to say, it may be broken down an infinite number of times. Imagine then that you break up a piece of matter ad infinitum. What would be leftCould small particles of extended dimension remain No, because if this were the case the piece of matter would not yet be broken up to infinity. Therefore, only points without extension would remain. But now let us try to put together the piece of matter starting from these points: by putting together two points without extension you cannot obtain a thing with extension, nor can you with three, or even with four. No matter how many you put together, in fact, you never have extension, because points have no extension. Therefore, we cannot think that matter is made of points without extension, because no matter how many of these we manage to put together, we never obtain something with an extended dimension. The only possibility, Democritus concludes, is that any piece of matter is made up of a finite number of discrete pieces which are indivisible, each one having finite size: the atoms.The origin of this subtle mode of argumentation pre dates Democritus. It comes from the Cilento region in the south of Italy, from a town now called Velia, which in the fifth century E was a flourishing Greek colony called Elea. Parmenides lived there, the philosopher who had taken to the letter perhaps too much the rationalism of Miletus and the idea born there that reason can reveal to us how things can be other than they appear. Parmenides had explored an avenue to truth via pure reason alone, a path which led him to declare that all appearances are illusory, thus opening a direction of thinking that would progressively move towards metaphysics and distance itself from what would come to be known as natural science. His pupil Zeno, also from Elea, had brought subtle arguments to bear in support of this fundamentalist rationalism, which refutes the credibility of appearances radically. Among these arguments there was a series of paradoxes that became celebrated as Zenos paradoxes they seek to show how all appearance is illusory, arguing that the commonplace notion of motion is absurd.The most famous of Zenos paradoxes is presented in the form of a brief fable: the tortoise challenges Achilles to a race, starting out with a tenmetre advantage. Will Achilles manage to catch up with the tortoise Zeno argues that rigorous logic dictates that he will never be able to do so. Before catching up, in effect, Achilles needs to cover the ten metres, and in order to do this he will take a certain amount of time. During this time, the tortoise will have advanced a few centimetres. To cover these centimetres, Achilles will have to take a little more time but, meanwhile, the tortoise will have advanced further, and so on, ad infinitum. Achilles therefore requires an infinite number of such times to reach the tortoise, and an infinite number of times, argues Zeno, is an infinite amount of time. Consequently, according to strict logic, Achilles will take an infinite time to reach the tortoise or rather, we will never see him do so. Since, however, we do see the swift Achilles reaching and overtaking as many tortoises as he likes, it follows that what we see is irrational, and therefore illusory.Lets be honest: this is hardly convincing. Where does the error lie One possible answer is that Zeno is wrong because it is not true that by accumulating an infinite number of things one ends up with an infinite thing. Think of taking a piece of string, cutting it in half, and then again in half, and again, ad infinitum. At the end, you will obtain an infinite number of small pieces of string the sum of these, however, will be finite, because they can only add up to the length of the original piece of string. Hence, an infinite number of strings can make a finite string an infinite number of increasingly short times may make a finite time, and the hero, even if he will have to cover an infinite number of distances, ever smaller, will take a finite time to do so, and will end up catching the tortoise.It seems that the paradox is resolved. The solution, that is, is in the idea of the continuum arbitrarily small times may exist, an infinite number of which make up a finite time. Aristotle is the first to intuit this possibility, which was subsequently developed by ancient and modern mathematics.fnBut is this really the correct solution in the real world Do arbitrarily short strings really exist Can we really cut a piece of string an arbitrary number of times Do infinitely small amounts of time exist This is precisely the problem that quantum gravity will have to face.According to tradition, Zeno had met Leucippus and had become his teacher. Leucippus was therefore familiar with Zenos riddles. But he had devised a different way of resolving them. Maybe, Leucippus suggests, nothing arbitrarily small exists: there is a lower limit to divisibility.The universe is granular, not continuous. With infinitely small points, it would be impossible ever to construct extension as in Democrituss argument, reported by Aristotle and mentioned above. Therefore, the extension of the string must be formed by a finite number of finite objects with finite size. The string cannot be cut as many times as we want matter is not continuous, it is made of individual atoms of a finite size.Whether this abstract argument is correct or not, its conclusion as we know today contains a great deal of truth. Matter does indeed have an atomic structure. If I divide a drop of water in two, I obtain two drops of water. I can divide each one of these two drops again, and so on. But I cannot continue to infinity. At a certain point I have only one molecule, and I have finished. No drops of water exist smaller than a single molecule of water.How do we know this today Evidence has accumulated over centuries, much of it from chemistry. Chemical substances are made up of combinations of a few elements and are formed by proportions of weight given by whole numbers. Chemists have constructed a way of thinking about substances as composed of molecules made up of fixed combinations of atoms. Water, for example O is composed of two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen.But these are only clues. Still at the beginning of the last century numerous scientists and philosophers did not consider the atomic hypothesis to be credible. Among them was the renowned physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach, whose ideas on space would come to have great importance for Einstein. At the end of a lecture by Ludwig Boltzmann at the Imperial Academy of Science in Vienna, Mach publicly declared, I do not believe that atoms exist! This was in . Many, like Mach, understood chemical notation only as a conventional method of summarizing laws of chemical reactions not as evidence that there actually were molecules of water composed of two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen. You cant see atoms, they would say. Atoms will never be seen, they would say. And then, they asked, how big would an atom be Democritus could never measure the size of his atoms But somebody else could. The definitive proof of the atomic hypothesis had to wait until . It was found by a rebellious twentyfiveyearold, who had studied physics but had not been able to find employment as a scientist and was making ends meet by working as an employee in the patent office in Berne. I will speak a lot about this young man in the rest of this book, and about the three articles he sent to the most prestigious physics journal of the time, the Annalen der Physik. The first of these articles contained the definitive proof that atoms exist, and calculated their dimensions, solving the problem posed by Leucippus and Democritus twentythree centuries earlier.Figure . Albert Einstein.The name of this twentyfiveyearold, obviously, is Albert Einstein.How does he do it The idea is surprisingly simple. Anyone could have arrived at it, from the time of Democritus onwards, if he had had Einsteins acumen and a sufficient mastery of mathematics to make what was not an easy calculation. The idea goes like this: if we observe attentively very small particles, such as a speck of dust or a grain of pollen, suspended in still air or in a liquid, we see them tremble and dance. Pushed by this trembling, they move, randomly zigzagging, and so they drift slowly, gradually moving away from their starting point. This motion of particles in a fluid is called Brownian motion, after Robert Brown, a biologist who described it in detail in the nineteenth century. The typical trajectory of a particle dancing in this manner is illustrated in figure .. It is as if the small particle is receiving blows randomly from each side of it. In fact, it isnt as if it were being hit, it really is hit. It trembles because it is hit by individual molecules of air, which collide with the particle at times from the right and at times from the left.Figure . Typical Brownian motion.The subtle point is the following. There are an enormous number of molecules of air. On average, as many hit the granule from the left as those that hit it from the right. If the airs molecules were infinitely small and infinitely numerous, the effect of the collisions from right and from left would balance and thus cancel out at each instant, and the granule would not move. But the finite size of the molecules the fact that these are present in finite rather than infinite number causes there to be fluctuations this is the key word: that is to say, the collisions never balance out exactly they only balance out on average. Imagine for a moment the molecules were very few in number and large in size: the granule would clearly receive a blow only occasionally now one on the right, then one on the left Between one collision and the other it would move here and there to a significant degree, like a football kicked by boys running around a playing field. The smaller the molecules, on the other hand, the shorter the interval between collisions and the better the hits from different directions balance and cancel each other out. And the less the granule moves.It is indeed possible, with a little mathematics, to work back from the amount of movement of the granule, which can be observed, to the dimensions of the molecules. Einstein does this, as I mentioned above, at the age of twentyfive. From observations of granules drifting in fluids, from the measurement of how much these drift that is, move away from a position he calculates the dimensions of Democrituss atoms, the elementary grains of which matter is made. He provides, after , years, the proof of the accuracy of Democrituss insight: matter is granular.The nature of thingsSublime Lucretiuss work will not die,Until the day the world itself passes away. OvidI often think that the loss of the works of Democritus in their entiretyfn is the greatest intellectual tragedy to ensue from the collapse of the old classical civilization. Take a look at the list of his works in the footnote it is difficult not to be dismayed, imagining what we have lost of the vast scientific reflections of antiquity.We have been left with all of Aristotle, by way of which Western thought reconstructed itself, and nothing by Democritus. Perhaps, if all of the works of Democritus had survived, and nothing of Aristotles, the intellectual history of our civilization would have been better But centuries dominated by monotheism have not permitted the survival of Democrituss naturalism. The closure of the ancient schools such as those of Athens and Alexandria and the destruction of all the texts not in accordance with Christian ideas were vast and systematic, at the time of the brutal antipagan repression following from the edicts of Emperor Theodosius, which, in declared that Christianity was to be the only and obligatory religion of the empire. Plato and Aristotle, pagans who believed in the immortality of the soul or in the existence of a Prime Mover, could be tolerated by a triumphant Christianity. Not Democritus.But a text survived the disaster, and has reached us in its entirety. Through it, we know a little about ancient atomism and, above all, we know the spirit of that science. It is the splendid poem De rerum natura The Nature of Things, or On the Nature of the Universe, by the Latin poet Lucretius.Lucretius adheres to the philosophy of Epicurus, a pupil of a pupil of Democritus. Epicurus is interested more in ethical than scientific questions and does not have Democrituss depth. He sometimes translates Democritean atomism a little superficially. But his vision of the natural world is substantially that of the great philosopher of Abdera. Lucretius decants in verse the thought of Epicurus and the atomism of Democritus, and in this way a part of this profound philosophy was saved from the intellectual catastrophe of the Dark Ages. Lucretius sings of atoms, the sea, the sky, of nature. He expresses in luminous verse philosophical questions, scientific ideas, refined arguments. I will explain by what forces nature steers the courses of the sun and the journeyings of the moon, so that we shall not suppose that they run their yearly races between the heaven and earth of their own free will or that they are rolled round in furtherance of some divine plan The beauty of the poem lies in the sense of wonder which pervades the vast atomistic vision the sense of the profound unity of things, derived from the knowledge that we are all made of the same substance as are the stars, and the sea: we are all sprung from heavenly seed. All alike have the same father, from whom allnourishing mother earth receives the showering drops of moisture. Thus fertilized, she gives birth to smiling crops and lusty trees, to mankind and all the breeds of beasts. She it is that yields the food on which they all feed their bodies, lead their joyous lives and renew their race There is a sense of luminous calm and serenity about the poem, which comes from understanding that there are no capricious gods demanding of us difficult things, and punishing us. There is a vibrant and airy joyfulness, beginning with the marvellous opening verses dedicated to Venus, a radiant symbol of the creative force of nature:Before you the winds flee, and at your coming the clouds forsake the sky. For you the ocean levels laugh, the sky is calmed and glows with diffused radiance.There is a deep acceptance of the life of which we are an integral part:Do you not see that nature is clamouring for two things only, a body free from pain, a mind released from worry and fear for the enjoyment of pleasurable sensationsAnd there is a serene acceptance of the inevitability of death, which cancels every evil and about which there is nothing to fear. For Lucretius, religion is ignorance reason is the torch that brings light.Lucretiuss text, forgotten for centuries, was rediscovered in January by the humanist Poggio Bracciolini, in the library of a German monastery. Poggio had been the secretary of many popes, and was a passionate hunter of ancient books, in the wake of the celebrated rediscoveries made by Francesco Petrarch. His rediscovery of a text by Quintilian modified the course of the study of law throughout the faculties of Europe his discovery of the treatise on architecture by Vitruvius transformed the way in which fine buildings were designed and constructed. But his triumph was rediscovering Lucretius. The actual codex found by Poggio has been lost, but the copy made by his friend Niccol Niccoli now known as the Codex Laurenziano . is still preserved in its entirety in Florences Biblioteca Laurenziana.The ground was already surely prepared for something new when Poggio gave Lucretiuss book back to humanity. Already, from Dantes generation, it had been possible to hear markedly new accents:Your eyes went shooting through my heartto wake my dormant thought.Look now, Im desperate and distraughtwith love that tears my life apart.But the rediscovery of De rerum natura had a profound effect upon the Italian and European Renaissance, and its echo resounds, directly or indirectly, in the pages of authors ranging from Galileo to Kepler, and from Bacon to Machiavelli. In Shakespeare, a century after Poggio, atoms make a delightful appearance:O , then I see Queen Mab hath been with you:She is the fairies midwife, and she comesIn shape no bigger than an agatestoneOn the forefinger of an alderman,Drawn with a little team of atomiesOver mens noses as they lie asleep Montaignes Essays include at least a hundred quotations from Lucretius. But the direct influence of Lucretius extended to Newton, Dalton, Spinoza, Darwin and all the way up to Einstein. The very idea of Einsteins that the existence of atoms is revealed by the Brownian motion of minute particles immersed in a fluid may be traced back to Lucretius. Here is a passage in which Lucretius provides a living proof of the notion of atoms:This process is illustrated by an image of it that is continually taking place before our very eyes. Observe what happens when sunbeams are admitted into a building and shed light on its shadowy places. You will see a multitude of tiny particles mingling in a multitude of ways in the empty space within the light of the beam, as though contending in everlasting conflict, rushing into battle rank upon rank with never a moments pause in a rapid sequence of unions and disunions. From this you may picture what it is for the atoms to be perpetually tossed about in the illimitable void. To some extent a small thing may afford an illustration and an imperfect image of great things. Besides, there is a further reason why you should give your mind to these particles that are seen dancing in a sunbeam: their dancing is an actual indication of underlying movements of matter that are hidden from our sight. There you will see many particles under the impact of invisible blows, changing their course and driven back upon their tracks, this way and that, in all directions. You must understand that they all derive this restlessness from the atoms. It originates with the atoms, which move of themselves. Then those small compound bodies that are least removed from the impetus of the atoms are set in motion by the impact of their invisible blows and in turn cannon against slightly larger bodies. So the movement mounts up from the atoms and gradually emerges to the level of our senses, so that those bodies are in motion that we see in sunbeams, moved by blows that remain invisible.Einstein resuscitated the living proof presented by Lucretius, and probably first conceived of by Democritus, and made it solid by translating it into mathematical terms, thus managing to calculate the size of the atoms.The Catholic Church attempted to stop Lucretius: in the Florentine Synod of December it prohibited the reading of Lucretius in schools. In , the Council of Trent banned his work. But it was too late. An entire vision of the world which had been swept away by medieval Christian fundamentalism was reemerging in a Europe which had reopened its eyes. It was not just the rationalism, atheism and materialism of Lucretius that were being proposed in Europe. It was not merely a luminous and serene meditation on the beauty of the world. It was much more: it was an articulate and complex structure of thinking about reality, a new mode of thinking, radically different from what had been for centuries the mindset of the Middle Ages.The medieval cosmos so marvellously sung by Dante was interpreted on the basis of a hierarchical organization of the universe which reflected the hierarchical organization of European society: a spherical cosmic structure with the Earth at its centre the irreducible separation between Earth and heavens finalistic and metaphorical explanations of natural phenomena. Fear of God, fear of death little attention to nature the idea that forms preceding things determine the structure of the world the idea that the source of knowledge could only be the past, in revelation and tradition There is none of this in the world of Democritus as sung by Lucretius. There is no fear of the gods no ends or purposes in the world no cosmic hierarchy no distinction between Earth and heavens. There is a deep love of nature, a serene immersion within it a recognition that we are profoundly part of it that men, women, animals, plants and clouds are organic threads of a marvellous whole, without hierarchies. There is a feeling of deep universalism in the wake of the splendid words of Democritus: To a wise man, the whole earth is open, because the true country of a virtuous soul is the entire universe.There is, too, the ambition of being able to think about the world in simple terms. Of being able to investigate and understand the secrets of nature. To know more than our parents. And there are extraordinary conceptual tools on which Galileo, Kepler and Newton will build: the idea of free rectilinear motion in space the idea of elementary bodies and their interactions, out of which the world is constructed the idea of space as a container of the world.And there is the simple idea of the finite divisibility of things. The granular quality of the world. The idea which stops the infinite between our fingers. This idea is at the root of the atomic hypothesis, but it will also return with augmented force with quantum mechanics, and today is revealing itself to be powerful again as the keystone of quantum gravity.The first person to make the parts of the mosaic which begin to emerge from Renaissance naturalism cohere and to reprise the Democritean vision, immensely reinforced, placing it at the centre of modern thought will be an Englishman, the greatest scientist of all time and the first protagonist of the following chapter.. The ClassicsIsaac and the little moonIf in the previous chapter I appeared to be saying that Plato and Aristotle have only done harm to the development of science, I would like to correct this impression. Aristotles studies of nature of botany and zoology, for example are extraordinary scientific works, grounded upon meticulous observations of the natural world. The conceptual clarity, the attention to the variety of nature, the impressive intelligence and the openness of mind of the great philosopher made him an authority for centuries to come. The first systematic physics that we know of is Aristotles, and it is not bad physics at all.Aristotle presents it in a book entitled, precisely, Physics. The book didnt take its title from the name of a discipline: it was the discipline which got its name from Aristotles book. For Aristotle, physics works as follows. First, it is necessary to distinguish between the heavens and Earth. In the heavens, everything is made up of a crystalline substance which moves in a circular motion and turns eternally around the Earth in great concentric circles, with the spherical Earth at the centre of everything. On the Earth, it is necessary to distinguish between forced motion and natural motion. Forced motion is caused by a thrust and ends when the thrust ends. Natural motion is vertical upwards or downwards and depends both on the substance and the location. Each substance has a natural place, that is to say, a proper altitude to which it always returns: earth at the bottom, water a little way above it, air a little higher still, and fire even higher. When you pick up a stone and let it fall, the stone moves downwards because it wants to return to its natural level. Air bubbles in water, fire in the air and childrens balloons move upwards, seeking their natural place.Do not smile at this theory, or dismiss it, because it is very sound physics. Its a good and correct description of the motion of bodies immersed in a fluid and subject to gravity and friction, namely, the real things we meet in our everyday experience. Its not wrong physics, as is frequently said.fn Its an approximation. But the physics of Newton, too, is an approximation of general relativity. And probably everything that we know today as well is an approximation of something else which we dont yet know. The physics of Aristotle is still rough, it is not quantitative we cannot compute with it, but it is coherent and rational and enables correct qualitative predictions to be made. It is not for nothing that it remained for centuries the best available model for understanding motion.Perhaps even more important for the future development of science is Plato.It is he who understood the value of the intuition of Pythagoras and Pythagorism: that the key to moving forwards, to going beyond Miletus, was mathematics.Pythagoras was born on Samos, a small island not far from Miletus. His first biographers, Iamblichus and Porphyry, report how young Pythagoras was a disciple of elderly Anaximander. Everything originates in Miletus. Pythagoras travelled widely, probably in Egypt and as far as Babylon, before finally settling in the south of Italy, at Crotone, where he founded a religiopoliticoscientific sect which played an important role in the politics of the little town but left a momentous legacy to the entire world: the discovery of the theoretical utility of mathematics: Number he is said to have asserted governs forms and ideas.Plato divested Pythagorism of its cumbersome and useless mystical baggage. He absorbed and distilled its useful message: mathematics is the language best adapted to understand and describe the world. The reach of this insight is immense it is one of the reasons for the success of Western science. According to tradition, Plato carved on the door of his school the phrase, Let no one enter here who is ignorant of geometry.Driven by this conviction, it was Plato who posed the momentous question: the question out of which, after a long detour, modern science would emerge. Of his disciples who studied mathematics he asked if they could find the mathematical laws followed by the celestial bodies visible in the heavens. Venus, Mars and Jupiter can be easily observed in the night sky. They seem to move a little at random, back and forth among the other stars. Is it possible to find a mathematics which is able to describe and predict their movementsThe exercise begins with Eudoxus in Platos school, and is pursued throughout the following centuries by astronomers such as Aristarchus and Hipparchus, bringing ancient astronomy on to an extremely high scientific level. We know of the triumphs of this science thanks to a single book, the only one to have survived: the Almagest of Ptolemy. Ptolemy was an astronomer who lived in Alexandria in the first century of our era, under the Roman Empire, when science was already in decline and about to disappear altogether, overwhelmed by the collapse of the Hellenistic world and suffocated by the Christianization of the empire.Ptolemys book is a major work of science. Rigorous, precise, complex, it presents a mathematical system of astronomy capable of predicting the seemingly random movements of the planets in the sky, with almost complete precision, given the limitations of the human eye. The book is the proof that the intuition of Pythagoras was correct. Mathematics allows the world to be described and the future to be predicted: the apparently wandering and disorderly movements of the planets can be precisely predicted by using mathematical formulae that Ptolemy, summarizing the results of centuries of work by Greek astronomers, presents in a systematic and masterly way. Even today, with a little studying, it is possible to open Ptolemys book, learn its techniques and calculate, for example, the position which Mars will have in a future sky. Today: two thousand years, that is, after the book was written. The realization that working this magic is really possible is the basis of modern science and owes not a little to Pythagoras and Plato.After the collapse of ancient science, no one throughout the Mediterranean was capable of understanding Ptolemy or any of the other small number of major scientific works that survived the catastrophe, such as the Elements of Euclid. In India, where Greek learning had arrived, thanks to rich commercial and cultural exchanges, these books were studied and understood.From India this knowledge returned to the West, thanks to learned Persian and Arab scientists who were able to understand and preserve it. But astronomy did not take any very significant step forward for over a thousand years.More or less at the same time as Poggio Bracciolini discovered the manuscript of Lucretius, the heady atmosphere of Italian humanism and the enthusiasm for ancient texts also intoxicated a young Pole who had come to study in Italy, first at Bologna, then at Padua. He signed himself in the Latin manner: Nicolaus Copernicus. The young Copernicus studies Ptolemys Almagest and falls in love with it. He decides to spend his life doing astronomy, following in the footsteps of the great Ptolemy.The time is now ripe and, more than a thousand years after Ptolemy, Copernicus is able to make the leap forward that generations of Indian, Arab and Persian astronomers had not been able to make: not simply learning, applying and adding small ameliorations to the Ptolemaic system but thoroughly improving it with the courage to change it in depth. Instead of describing heavenly bodies turning around the Earth, Copernicus writes a sort of revised and corrected version of Ptolemys Almagest, in which the Sun is at the centre and the Earth, together with the other planets, runs around it.In this way Copernicus hopes the calculations would work even better. In reality, they did not work much better than those of Ptolemy in fact, in the end, they turned out to work less well. But the idea was, nevertheless, sound: in the succeeding generation, Johannes Kepler shows that the Copernican system can really be made to function better than Ptolemys. Painstakingly analysing new, precise observations, Kepler shows that a few new mathematical laws can describe with exactitude the movements of the planets around the Sun, with a degree of accuracy even greater than any obtained in antiquity. We are now in , and for the first time humanity finds out how to do something better than what was done in Alexandria more than a thousand years earlier.While Kepler in the cold north calculates movements in the sky, in Italy it is with Galileo Galilei that the new science begins to take off. Exuberant, Italian, polemical, argumentative, highly cultured, exceptionally intelligent and overflowing with inventiveness, Galileo gets sent from Holland a new invention the telescope and makes a gesture which changes human history. He points it towards the sky.Like Roy in Blade Runner, he sees things we people wouldnt believe: rings around Saturn, mountains on the moon, phases of Venus, moons orbiting Jupiter Each of these phenomena renders Copernicuss ideas more plausible. Scientific instruments begin to open the myopic eyes of humankind on to a world vaster and more varied than it had as yet been able to conceive of.But Galileos grand idea is to make the logical deduction from the cosmic revolution brought about by Copernicus: convinced that the Earth is a planet like all others, Galileo reasons that, if movements in the heavens follow precise mathematical laws, and if the Earth is a planet like all others, and thus part of the heavens, then there must also exist precise mathematical laws governing the movements of objects on Earth.Confident of the rationality of nature and of the PythagoreanPlatonic vision that nature is understandable through mathematics, Galileo decides to study how objects move on Earth when they are set free that is, when they fall. Convinced that a relevant mathematical law must exist, he sets out to search for it, by trial and error. For the first time in the history of mankind, an experiment is made. Experimental science begins with Galileo. His experiment is simple: he lets objects fall that is, he lets them follow what for Aristotle was their natural movement and seeks to measure precisely their falling speed.The result is momentous: objects do not fall always at a constant speed, as everybody thought. Their speed, instead, gradually increases during the early part of the fall. In this phase, what is constant is not the speed of the fall but rather the acceleration, that is to say, the rate at which speed increases. And, magically, this acceleration turns out to be the same for all objects. Galileo completes a first rough measurement of this acceleration and finds it constant. Its value is approximately . metres per second per second, which is to say that for every second that an object falls, its speed increases by . metres per second. Keep in mind this number.This is the first mathematical law discovered for earthly bodies: the law of falling bodies.fn Up until this point, only mathematical laws for the movements of the planets had been discovered. Mathematical perfection is no longer confined to the heavens.But the greatest result is still to come, and it will be Isaac Newton who will attain it. Newton studies in depth the results of Galileo and Kepler and by combining them, finds the hidden diamond. We can follow his reasoning in terms of the little moon, as he himself tells it in The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, the book that forms the foundation of modern science.Imagine that the Earth, writes Newton, had many moons, like Jupiter. In addition to the real Moon, imagine other moons, and in particular a little moon which orbits the Earth at a minimal distance from it, just above the mountain peaks. At what speed would this little moon travel One of the laws discovered by Kepler relates the radius of orbit with period, namely, the time taken to complete an orbit.fn We know the radius of the orbit of the real Moon Hipparchus had measured it in antiquity and its period one month. We know the radius of the orbit of the little moon the radius of the Earth, measured by Eratosthenes in antiquity. With a simple proportion we can compute the period of the orbit of the little moon. The result is one hour and a half. The little moon would complete its orbit around the Earth every one hour and a half.Now, an object which orbits does not go straight: it continually changes direction, and a change of direction is an acceleration. The little moon accelerates towards the centre of the Earth. This acceleration is easy to compute.fn Newton makes the simple calculation, and the result is . metres per second per second! The same acceleration as in Galileos experiments for falling bodies on Earth.Coincidence It cant be, reasons Newton. If the effect is the same a downwards acceleration of . metres per second per second the cause must be the same. And so: the force which causes the little moon to turn around its orbit must be the same as that which causes objects to fall to the ground on Earth.We call the force causing objects to fall gravity. Newton understands that it is this same gravity that makes the little moon turn around the Earth. Without this gravity it would run away in a straight line. But then, also, the real Moon must orbit the Earth because of gravity! And the moons which orbit Jupiter are attracted by Jupiter, and the planets which turn around the Sun are attracted by the Sun! Without this attraction, every celestial body would move in a straight line. So the universe, then, is a large space where bodies attract one another by means of forces and there is a universal force: gravity every body attracts every other body.An immense vision takes shape. Suddenly, after millennia, there is no longer separation between the heavens and Earth there is no natural level for things, as Aristotle presumed there is no centre to the world things let free no longer seek their natural place but move in a straight line, for ever.A simple calculation with the little moon allows Newton to deduce how the force of gravity changes with distance and to determine its strength, given by what we call today Newtons constant, indicated by the letter G for gravity. On Earth, this force causes things to fall in the heavens it holds planets and satellites on their orbits. The force is the same.Its a subversion of the conceptual structure of the Aristotelian world, the dominant vision of the world throughout the Middle Ages. Think of Dantes universe, for example: just as for Aristotle, Earth is a ball at the centre of the universe, orbited by the celestial spheres. Not any more. The universe is an immense, infinite space studded with stars, without limit and without centre. Within it, material bodies run free and straight, unless a force, generated by another body, deviates them. Reference to ancient atomism is clear in Newton, even if still formulated in conventional terms:It seems probable to me that God, in the beginning, formed matter in solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, moveable particles, of such sizes and figures, and with such other properties, and in such proportions to space The world of Newtonian mechanics is simple, and is summarized in figures . and .. It is the world of Democritus reborn. A world made of a vast, undifferentiated space, always equal to itself, where particles run for ever and act upon each other and nothing else. The world sung by Leopardi: sitting here and gazing, I find that endlessSpaces beyond that hedge, and morethanhumanSilences, and the deepest peace and quietAre fashioned in my thought But now the vision is immensely more powerful than in Democritus, because it is not just a mental image with which to order the world: it is now combined with mathematics, with the legacy of Pythagoras, and with the mighty tradition of the Alexandrian astronomers mathematical physics. The world of Newton is the world of Democritus, rendered mathematical.Figure . What is the world made ofFigure . The world of Newton: particles which move in space, as time passes, attracted by forces.Newton acknowledges without hesitation the debt that the new science owes to the science of antiquity. In the first lines of his The System of the World, for example, he attributes to antiquity correctly the origins of the idea at the basis of the Copernican revolution: It was the opinion of the ancient philosophers that in the highest parts of the world the stars remain fixed and motionless, and that the Earth turns around the Sun although he is a bit confused as to who did what in the past, and quotes sometimes appositely, sometimes out of context Philolaus, Aristarchus of Samos, Anaximander, Plato, Anaxagoras, Democritus and ! the learned Numa Pompilius, king of the Romans.The power of the new Newtonian intellectual framework proves to be beyond all expectation. The entire technology of the nineteenth century and of our own modern world rests largely upon Newtons formulae. Three centuries have passed, but its still thanks to theories based upon Newtons equations that today we build bridges, trains and skyscrapers, engines and hydraulic systems that we know how to fly planes, make weather forecasts, predict the existence of a planet before seeing it and send spaceships to Mars The modern world would not have been born without passing by way of Newtons little moon.A new conception of the world, a way of thinking which raised the enthusiasm of the Enlightenment of Voltaire and Kant, an effective way for predicting the future: this has been and continues to be the immense legacy of the Newtonian revolution.It seemed thus that the final key to understanding reality had been discovered: the world consists only of a great, infinite space where, as time passes, particles move and attract one another by means of forces. We can write precise equations that describe these forces. These equations prove to be immensely effective. Still in the nineteenth century, people said that Newton was not only one of the most intelligent and farseeing of men but also the most fortunate because there is only one system of fundamental laws, and he was given the good fortune of discovering it. Everything seemed clear.But is that really allMichael: fields and lightNewton knew that his equations did not describe all the forces that exist in nature. There are forces other than gravity that act upon bodies. Things dont move just when they fall. The first problem left open by Newton was to understand the other forces that determine what happens around us. This had to wait until the nineteenth century, and it led to two surprises.The first surprise is that almost all phenomena we see are governed by a single force, other than gravity: the force that today we call electromagnetism. It is this force which holds together the matter that forms solid bodies holds together atoms in molecules, and electrons in atoms. This is what makes chemistry and living matter work. It is this force which operates in the neurons of our brain and governs our processing of the information on the world we perceive, and the way we think. And its always this force that creates the friction which stops a sliding object, which softens the landing of a parachutist, which turns electric motors and combustion engines,fn or that allows us to turn on lights and listen to the radio.The second and biggest surprise, crucial to the story Im telling, is that understanding this force requires an important modification to the world of Newton: the modification out of which modern physics was born, and the most important notion to keep in focus, to understand the rest of this book the notion of field.The understanding of how electromagnetic force works was made by another Briton, or rather by two: sciences oddest couple Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell.Michael Faraday is an impoverished Londoner without formal education, who works first in a bookbindery, then in a laboratory, where he excels, gains his masters confidence and grows into the most brilliant experimenter of nineteenthcentury physics and its greatest visionary. Without knowing mathematics, he writes one of the best books of physics ever written, virtually devoid of equations. He sees physics with his minds eye, and with his minds eye creates worlds. James Clerk Maxwell is a rich Scottish aristocrat and one of the greatest mathematicians of the century. Despite being separated by a gulf in intellectual style as well as social origin, they succeed in understanding each other and, together, combining two kinds of genius, they open the way to modern physics.Figure . Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell.What was known about electricity and magnetism at the beginning of the eighteenth century consisted of little other than a few amusing sideshow tricks: glass rods which attract pieces of paper magnets which repel and attract. The study of electricity and magnetism continued slowly throughout the eighteenth century and into the nineteenth, where we find Faraday working in a London laboratory full of bobbins, needles, knives and iron cages, exploring how electrical and magnetic things attract and repel. A good Newtonian, he tries to understand the force which acts between charged and magnetic things. But slowly, guided by his hands, in close contact with these objects, he is led to an intuition that will become the basis of modern physics. He sees something new.His intuition is this: we must not think of forces acting directly between distant objects, as Newton presumed. We must instead think that there exists an entity diffused throughout space, which is modified by electric and magnetic bodies and which, in turn, acts upon pushes and pulls the bodies. This entity, whose existence Faraday intuits, is today called the field.What is it, then, a field Faraday sees it as formed by bundles of very thin lines infinitely thin, which fill space an invisible, gigantic cobweb filling everything around us. He calls these lines lines of force because, in some way, these lines carry the force: they transmit the electric and the magnetic forces from one body to another, as if they were cables pulling and pushing figure ..An object with an electric charge a rubbed glass rod, for instance distorts the electric and magnetic fields the lines around itself, and in turn these fields produce a force on each charged object immersed in them. Thus, two distant charged objects do not attract or repel each other directly but only via the medium interposed between them.Figure . The fields lines fill space. Through them, two objects with electrical charge interact. The force of the two objects is carried by the fields lines of force.If you take two magnets in your hands and play with them, bringing them together and apart repeatedly, feeling the force with which they attract and repel, it is not difficult to experience the same intuition as Faraday, to feel via these effects the field interposed between the magnets.This is a radically different idea from the Newtonian notion of a force acting between distant bodies. But it would have appealed to Newton. Newton, indeed, was perplexed regarding this very attraction at a distance that he himself had introduced. How does the Earth manage to attract the Moon, which is so distant How can the Sun attract the Earth without coming into contact with it He had written in a letter:It is inconceivable that inanimate brute matter should, without the intervention of something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter, and have an effect upon it, without mutual contact.And, further down the page, we even find:That Gravity should be innate, inherent and essential to Matter, so that one Body may act upon another at a Distance thro a Vacuum, without the Mediation of any thing else, by and through which their Action and Force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an Absurdity, that I believe no Man who has in philosophical Matters a competent Faculty of thinking, can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an Agent acting constantly according to certain Laws but whether this Agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the Consideration of my Readers.Newton is deeming his very own masterwork to be absurd the very same work which was to be praised for centuries to come as the ultimate achievement of science! He understands that behind the action at a distance of his theory there must be something else, but he has no idea what, and leaves the question to the Consideration of my Readers!It is characteristic of genius to be aware of the limitations of its own findings, even in the case of such momentous outcomes as Newtons discovery of the laws of mechanics and universal gravity. Newtons theory worked so well, it turned out to be so useful, that for two centuries no one bothered any longer to question it until Faraday, the reader to whom Newton had bequeathed the unanswered question, found the key to understanding how bodies can attract and repel each other at a distance in a reasonable manner. Einstein will later apply Faradays brilliant solution to Newtons own theory of gravity.Introducing the new entity the field Faraday departs radically from Newtons elegant and simple ontology: the world is no longer made up only of particles that move in space while time passes. A new actor the field appears on the scene. Faraday is aware of the importance of the step he is taking. There are beautiful passages in his book where he asks whether these lines of force could be things with a real existence. After doubts and different considerations, he concludes that he thinks they are indeed real, but with the hesitation that is necessary when faced with the deepest questions of science. He is conscious that he is suggesting nothing less than a modification of the structure of the world, after two centuries of uninterrupted successes for Newtonian physics figure ..Figure . The world of Faraday and Maxwell: particles and fields which move in space, with the passage of time.Maxwell quickly realizes that gold has been struck with this idea. He translates Faradays insight, which Faraday explains only in words, into a page of equations.fn These are now known as Maxwells equations. They describe the behaviour of the electric and the magnetic fields: the mathematical version of the Faraday lines.fnToday, Maxwells equations are used daily to describe all electric and magnetic phenomena, to design antennae, radios, electric engines and computers. And this is not all: these same equations are needed to explain how atoms function they are held together by electrical forces, and why the particles of the material that forms a stone adhere together, or how the Sun works. They describe an amazing number and range of phenomena. Almost everything that we witness taking place with the exception of gravity, but little else besides is well described by Maxwells equations.But there is more. There is still what is perhaps the most beautiful success of science: Maxwells equations tell us what light is.Maxwell realizes that his equations predict that Faradays lines can tremble and undulate, just like the waves of the sea. He computes the speed at which the undulations of Faradays lines move and the result turns out to be the same as for light! Why Maxwell understands: because light is nothing other than this rapid trembling of Faradays lines! Not only have Faraday and Maxwell figured out how electricity and magnetism work but, with the same stroke, as a collateral effect, they have figured out what light is.We see the world around us in colour. What is colour Put simply, it is the frequency the speed of oscillation of the electromagnetic wave that light is. If the wave vibrates more rapidly, the light is bluer. If it vibrates a little more slowly, the light is redder. Colour, as we perceive it, is the psychophysical reaction of the nerve signal generated by the receptors of our eyes, which distinguish electromagnetic waves of different frequencies.I wonder how Maxwell felt when he realized that his equations written to describe bobbins, small cages and little needles in Faradays lab turned out to explain the nature of light and colour Light is thus nothing more than a rapid vibration of the spiderweb of Faradays lines, which ripple like the surface of a lake as the wind blows. It isnt true that we do not see Faraday lines. We only see vibrating Faraday lines. To see is to perceive light, and light is the movement of Faraday lines. Nothing leaps from one location in space to another without something transporting it. If we see a child playing on the beach, it is only because between them and ourselves there is this lake of vibrating lines which transport their image to us. Is the world not marvellousThe discovery is extraordinary, but there is even more. The ultimate corollary of the discovery has a concrete value for us that is unequalled. Maxwell recognizes that the equations foresee that Faradays lines can also vibrate at much lower frequencies, that is to say, more slowly than light. Therefore, there must be other waves which nobody had yet seen, produced by the movement of electrical charges, which in turn move electrical charges. It must be possible to shake an electric charge here, and to produce a wave which will drive an electric current there. Only a few years later, these waves, anticipated theoretically by Maxwell, will be revealed by the German physicist Heinrich Hertz and just a few years later still, Guglielmo Marconi builds the first radio.All modern communications technology radio, television, telephones, computers, satellites, wifi, the internet, etc. is an application of Maxwells prediction the Maxwell equations are the basis for all calculations made by telecommunications engineers. The contemporary world, based on communications, emerges from the intuitions of a poor London bookbinder a skilful explorer of ideas with a vivid imagination who saw some lines in his minds eye and the work of a good mathematician who translated this vision into equations, understanding that in the blink of an eye the waves of these lines can carry news from one side of the planet to the other.Figure . What is the world made ofOur entire current technology is founded on the use of a physical thing electromagnetic waves which was not discovered empirically: it was predicted by Maxwell, simply by searching for the mathematical description accounting for the intuition Faraday got from bobbins and needles. This is the outstanding power of theoretical physics.The world has changed: it is no longer made up of particles in space but of particles and fields in space figure .. It seems a minor change, but a few decades later a young Jewish man, a citizen of the world, will draw from it consequences that will go far beyond Michael Faradays already fervid imagination, and which will shake Newtons world even further to its core. Part Two E G F E Twentiethcentury physics has radically modified the Newtonian image of the world. The new steps are the basis of a great deal of todays technology. The deepening of our understanding of the world is based on two theories: general relativity and quantum mechanics. Both demand a daring reevaluation of our conventional ideas about the world: space and time in relativity matter and energy in quantum theory.In this part of the book I describe the two theories in some detail, trying to clarify their core meaning and highlight the conceptual revolution they brought about. Its here that the magic of twentiethcentury physics begins. Studying and trying to understand them in depth is a bewitching adventure.These two theories relativity and the quanta provide the basis on which we are today building a quantum theory of gravity. They are the ground from which we are trying to move forwards.. AlbertThe father of Albert Einstein built power stations in Italy. When Albert was a young boy, the Maxwell equations were only a few decades old but Italy was entering its industrial revolution, and the turbines and transformers that his father constructed were already based on them. The power of the new physics was obvious.Albert was a rebel. His parents left him in Germany to attend high school, but he found the German school system too rigid and militaristic he could not stand the authority of the school and abandoned his studies. He joined his parents in Italy, in Pavia, and spent his time loafing. Later, he went to study in Switzerland, initially failing to get into the Zurich Polytechnic, as he wished. After his university years he could not find a research position and, in order to live with the girl he loved, he found employment in the patent office of Berne.It wasnt much of a profession for a physics graduate, but it gave Albert time to think, and to work independently. And he did think and work. After all, this is what he had done since his early youth: he would read Euclids Elements and Kants Critique of Pure Reason instead of attending to what he was being taught at school. You dont get to new places by following established tracks.At the age of twentyfive, Einstein sends to the Annalen der Physik three articles. Each was worthy of a Nobel Prize, and more. Each one of the three is a pillar supporting our understanding of the world. I have already spoken of the first article, in which the young Albert calculates the dimensions of atoms and proves, after twentythree centuries, that the ideas of Democritus were correct: matter is granular.The second article is the one for which Einstein is most famous the article in which he introduces the theory of relativity and it is to the theory of relativity that this chapter is devoted.In fact, there are two theories of relativity. The envelope sent by the twentyfiveyearold Einstein contained the exposition of the first of these: the theory known today as special relativity. This is an important clarification of the structure of space and time, which I illustrate here before turning to the other, and most important of Einsteins theories: general relativity.Special relativity is a subtle and conceptually difficult theory. It is more difficult to digest than general relativity. Reader, dont become demoralized if the next few pages sound a bit abstruse. The theory shows, for the first time, that in the Newtonian vision of the world there isnt just something missing: rather, it must be radically modified in a way that goes completely against common sense. It is the first real leap into the revision of our most intuitive understanding of the world.The extended presentThe theories of Newton and of Maxwell appear to contradict each other in a subtle way. Maxwells equations determine a velocity: the velocity of light. But Newtons mechanics is not compatible with the existence of a fundamental velocity, because what enters Newtons equations is acceleration, not velocity. In Newtons physics, velocity can only be velocity of something with respect to something else. Galileo had underlined the fact that the Earth moves with respect to the Sun, even if we do not perceive this movement, because what we usually term velocity is velocity with respect to Earth. Velocity, we say, is a relative concept, that is, there is no meaning to the velocity of an object by itself: the only velocity which exists is the velocity of an object with respect to another object. This is what physics students learned in the nineteenth century, and what they learn today. But if this is so, then the speed of light determined by Maxwells equations is velocity with respect to whatOne possibility is that there is a kind of universal substratum in relation to which light moves and has its speed. But the predictions of Maxwells theory seem to be independent of this substratum. The experimental attempts to measure the speed of the Earth with respect to this hypothetical substratum tried at the end of the twentieth century all failed.Einstein has claimed that he was not put on the right track by any experiments but only by reflecting on the apparent contradiction between Maxwells equations and Newtons mechanics. He asked himself whether there was a way of rendering Newtons and Galileos core discoveries and Maxwells theory consistent.In doing so, Einstein arrives at a stupefying discovery. To understand it, think of all the past, present and future events with respect to the moment in which you are reading and imagine them distributed as in figure ..Well, Einsteins discovery is that this diagram is incorrect. In reality, things are actually as they are depicted in figure ..Between the past and the future of an event for example, between the past and the future for you, where you are, and in the precise moment in which you are reading there exists an intermediate zone, an expanded present a zone that is neither past nor future. This is the discovery made with special relativity.Figure . Space and time before Einstein.Figure . The structure of spacetime. For every observer, the extended present is the intermediate zone between the past and the future.The duration of this intermediate zone,fn which is neither in your past nor in your future, is very small and depends on where an event takes place relative to you, as illustrated in figure .: the greater the distance of the event from you, the longer the duration of the extended present. At a distance of a few metres from your nose, dear reader, the duration of what for you is the intermediate zone, neither past nor future, is no more than a few nanoseconds: next to nothing the number of nanoseconds in a second is the same as the number of seconds in thirty years. This is much less than we could possibly notice. On the other side of the ocean, the duration of this intermediate zone is a thousandth of a second, still well below the threshold of our perception of time the minimum amount of time we perceive with our senses which is somewhere in the order of a tenth of a second. But on the Moon the duration of the expanded present is a few seconds, and on Mars it is a quarter of an hour. This means we can say that, on Mars, there are events that in this precise moment have already happened, events that are yet to happen, but also a quarter of an hour during which things occur that are neither in our past nor in our future.They are elsewhere. We had never before been aware of this elsewhere because, next to us, this elsewhere is too brief we are not quick enough to notice it. But it exists, and it is real.This is why it is impossible to hold a smooth conversation between here and Mars. Say I am on Mars and you are here. I ask you a question and you reply as soon as youve heard what I said your reply reaches me a quarter of an hour after I posed the question. This quarter of an hour is time that is neither past nor future to the moment in which youve replied to me. The key fact about nature that Einstein understood is that this quarter of an hour is inevitable: there is no way of reducing it. It is woven into the texture of the events of space and of time: we cannot abbreviate it, any more than we can send a letter to the past.Figure . The relativity of simultaneity.Its strange, but this is how the world happens to be. As strange as the fact that in Sydney people live upside down: strange, but true. One gets accustomed to the fact, which then becomes normal and reasonable. It is the structure of space and time that is made like this.This implies that it makes no sense to say of an event on Mars that it is taking place just now, because just now does not exist figure ..fn In technical terms, we say that Einstein has understood that absolute simultaneity does not exist: there is no collection of events in the universe which exist now. The collection of all the events in the universe cannot be described as a succession of nows, of presents, one following the other it has a more complex structure, illustrated in figure .. The figure describes that which in physics is called spacetime: the set of all past and future events, but also those that are neitherpastnorfuture these do not form a single instant: they have themselves a duration.In the Andromeda Galaxy, the duration of this expanded present is with respect to us million years. Everything that happens during these million years is neither past nor future with respect to ourselves. If a friendly advanced Andromeda civilization decided to send a fleet of spacecraft to visit us, it would make no sense to ask whether now the fleet has already left, or not yet. The only meaningful question is when we receive the first signal from the fleet: from that moment on not earlier the departure of the fleet is in our past.The discovery of the structure of spacetime made by the young Einstein in has concrete consequences. The fact that space and time are intimately connected, as in figure ., implies a subtle restructuring of Newtons mechanics, which Einstein rapidly completes in and . A first result of this restructuring is that, as space and time fuse together in a single concept of spacetime, so the electric field and the magnetic fields fuse together in the same way, merging into a single entity which today we call the electromagnetic field. The complicated equations written by Maxwell for the two fields become simple when written in this new language.There is another implication of the theory, freighted with heavy consequences. The concepts of energy and mass become combined in the same way as time and space, and electric and magnetic fields, are fused together in the new mechanics. Before two general principles appeared certain: conservation of mass, and conservation of energy. The first had been extensively verified by chemists: mass never changes in a chemical reaction. The second conservation of energy followed directly from Newtons equations and was considered one of the most incontrovertible laws. But Einstein realizes that energy and mass are two facets of the same entity, just as the electric and magnetic fields are two facets of the same field, and as space and time are two facets of the one thing: spacetime. This implies that mass, by itself, is not conserved and energy as it was conceived at the time is not independently conserved either. One may be transformed into the other: only one single law of conservation exists, not two. What is conserved is the sum of mass and energy, not each separately. Processes must exist that transform energy into mass, or mass into energy.A rapid calculation teaches Einstein how much energy is obtained by transforming one gram of mass. The result is the celebrated formula E mc. Since the speed of light c is a very large number, and c an even greater number, the energy obtained from transforming one gram of mass is enormous it is the energy of millions of bombs exploding at the same time enough energy to illuminate a city and power the industries of a country for months or, conversely, capable of destroying in a second hundreds of thousands of human beings, in a city such as Hiroshima.The theoretical speculations of the young Einstein had transported humanity into a new era: the era of nuclear power, an era of new possibilities, and new dangers. Today, thanks to the intelligence of a rebellious young man who would not abide rules, we have the instruments to bring light to the homes of the billion human beings who will soon inhabit the planet, to travel in space towards other stars, or to destroy each other and devastate the planet. It depends on our choices on which leaders we call upon to decide for us.Today the structure of spacetime proposed by Einstein is well understood and repeatedly tested in laboratories it is considered conclusively established. Time and space are different from the way they had been conceived since Newton. Space does not exist independently from time. In the expanded space of figure . there is no particular slice having a better claim than others to be called space now. Our intuitive idea of the present the ensemble of all events happening now in the universe is an effect of our blindness: our inability to recognize small temporal intervals. It is an illegitimate extrapolation from our parochial experience.The present is like the flatness of the Earth: an illusion. We imagined a flat Earth because of the limitations of our senses, because we cannot see much beyond our own noses. Had we lived on an asteroid of a few kilometres in diameter, like the Little Prince, we would have easily realized we were on a sphere. Had our brain and our senses been more precise, had we easily perceived time in nanoseconds, we would never have made up the idea of a present extending everywhere. We would have easily recognized the existence of the intermediate zone between past and future. We would have realized that saying here and now makes sense, but that saying now to designate events happening now throughout the universe makes no sense. It is like asking whether our galaxy is above or below the galaxy of Andromeda: a question that makes no sense, because above or below has meaning on the surface of the Earth, not in the universe. There isnt an up or a down in the universe. Similarly, there isnt either always a before and an after between two events in the universe. The resulting knitted structure that space and time form together, depicted in figures like . and ., is what physicists call spacetime figure ..When the Annalen der Physik published the article by Einstein in which all this was suddenly clarified, the impact upon the world of physics was momentous. The apparent contradiction between the equations of Maxwell and Newtonian physics were well known, and no one knew how to resolve them. Einsteins solution, astonishing and extremely elegant, took everyone by surprise. The story goes that in the dimly lit old halls of Cracow University, an austere professor of physics came out of his study, waving around Einsteins article, screaming, The new Archimedes is born!But despite the outcry provoked by the step forwards made by Einstein in , we are not yet at his masterpiece. Einsteins triumph is the second theory of relativity, the theory of general relativity, published ten years later, when he was thirtyfive.Figure . What is the world made ofThe theory of general relativity is the most beautiful theory produced by physics, and the first of the pillars of quantum gravity. It is at the heart of the narrative of this book. Here, the real magic of twentiethcentury physics begins.The most beautiful of theoriesAfter publishing the theory of special relativity, Einstein becomes a renowned physicist and receives offers of work from numerous universities. But something troubles him: special relativity does not square with what was known about gravity. He realizes this while writing a review on his theory, and wonders whether the venerable theory of the universal gravity of the father of physics, Newton, should not be reconsidered as well, to make it compatible with his relativity.The origin of the problem is easy to understand. Newton had tried to explain why things fall and planets revolve. He had imagined a force that draws all bodies towards one another: the force of gravity. How this force managed to draw distant things together without anything between them was not understood. Newton himself, as we have seen, had suspected that in the idea of a force acting between distant bodies that do not touch there was something missing and that in order for the Earth to attract the Moon something that could transmit this force had to be there between the two. Two hundred years later, Faraday had found the solution not for the force of gravity, but for the electric and magnetic forces: the field. Electric and magnetic fields carry around the electric and magnetic force.Its clear, at this stage, to any reasonable person, that the force of gravity must have its Faraday lines as well. Its clear also, by analogy, that the force of attraction between the Sun and the Earth, or between the Earth and falling objects, must be attributed to a field in this case, a gravitational field. The solution discovered by Faraday and Maxwell to the question as to what carries the force must reasonably be applied not only to electricity but also to gravity. There must be a gravitational field, and some equations analogous to Maxwells, capable of describing how Faradays gravitational lines move. In the first years of the twentieth century this is clear to any sufficiently reasonable person that is to say, only to Albert Einstein.Einstein, fascinated since adolescence by the electromagnetic field that pushed the rotors in his fathers power stations, begins to look into this gravitational field and search for what kind of maths could describe it. He immerses himself in the problem. It would take ten years to resolve. Ten years of manic studies, attempts, mistakes, confusion, brilliant ideas, wrong ideas, a long series of articles published with incorrect equations, further mistakes and stress. Finally, in , he commits to print an article containing the complete solution, which he names the General Theory of Relativity: his masterpiece. It is Lev Landau, the most outstanding theoretical physicist of the Soviet Union, who called it the most beautiful of theories.The reason for the beauty of the theory is not hard to see. Instead of simply inventing the mathematical form of the gravitational field and seeking to devise the equations for it, Einstein fishes out the other unresolved question in the furthest depths of Newtons theory and combines the two questions.Newton had returned to Democrituss idea, according to which bodies move in space. This space had to be a large, empty container, a rigid box for the universe an immense scaffolding in which objects run in straight lines, until a force causes them to curve. But what is this space which contains the world made of What is spaceTo us, the idea of space seems natural, but it is our familiarity with Newtonian physics that makes it so. If you think about it, empty space is not part of our experience. From Aristotle to Descartes, that is to say, for two millennia, the Democritean idea of space as a peculiar entity, distinct from things, had never been seen as reasonable. For Aristotle, as for Descartes, things have extension: extension is a property of things extension does not exist without something being extended. I can take away the water from a glass, but air will fill it. Have you ever seen a really empty glassIf between two things there is nothing, Aristotle reasoned, then there is nothing. How can there be at the same time something space and nothing What is this empty space within which particles move Is it something, or is it nothing If it is nothing, it doesnt exist, and we can do without it. If it is something, can it be true that its only property is to be there, doing nothingSince antiquity, the idea of empty space, halfway between a thing and a nonthing, had troubled thinkers. Democritus himself, who had placed empty space at the basis of his world where atoms course, certainly wasnt crystal clear on the issue: he wrote that empty space is something between being and nonbeing: Democritus postulated the full and the empty, calling one Being, and the other NonBeing, says Simplicius. Atoms are being. Space is nonbeing a nonbeing that, nevertheless, exists. It is difficult to be more obscure than this.Newton, who resuscitated the Democritean idea of space, had tried to patch things up by arguing that space was Gods sensorium. No one has ever understood what Newton meant by Gods sensorium, perhaps not even Newton himself. Certainly, Einstein, who gave little credit to the idea of a God with or without a sensorium, except as a playful rhetorical device, found Newtons explanation of the nature of space utterly unconvincing.Newton struggled considerably to overcome the scientists and philosophers resistance to his reviving the Democritean concept of space at first nobody took him seriously. Only the extraordinary efficacy of his equations, which turned out to predict always the correct outcome, ended up silencing criticism. But doubts concerning the plausibility of the Newtonian concept of space persisted, and Einstein, who read philosophers, was well aware of them. Ernst Mach, whose influence Einstein readily acknowledged, was the philosopher who highlighted the conceptual difficulties of the Newtonian idea of space the same Mach who did not believe in the existence of atoms. A good example, incidentally, of how the same person can be shortsighted in one respect and farseeing in another.Thus, Einstein addresses not one but two problems. First, how can we describe the gravitational field Second, what is Newtons spaceAnd its here that Einsteins extraordinary stroke of genius occurs, one of the greatest flights in the history of human thinking: what if the gravitational field turned out actually to be Newtons mysterious space What if Newtons space was nothing more than the gravitational field This extremely simple, beautiful, brilliant idea is the theory of general relativity.Figure . What is the world made ofThe world is not made up of space particles electromagnetic field gravitational field. The world is made up of particles fields, and nothing else there is no need to add space as an extra ingredient. Newtons space is the gravitational field. Or vice versa, which amounts to saying the same thing: the gravitational field is space figure ..But, unlike Newtons space, which is flat and fixed, the gravitational field, by virtue of being a field, is something which moves and undulates, subject to equations like Maxwells field, like Faradays lines.It is a momentous simplification of the world. Space is no longer different from matter. It is one of the material components of the world, akin to the electromagnetic field. It is a real entity which undulates, fluctuates, bends and contorts.We are not contained within an invisible, rigid scaffolding: we are immersed in a gigantic, flexible mollusc the metaphor is Einsteins. The Sun bends space around itself, and the Earth does not circle around it drawn by a mysterious distant force but runs straight in a space that inclines. Its like a bead which rolls in a funnel: there are no mysterious forces generated by the centre of the funnel, it is the curved nature of the funnel wall which guides the rotation of the bead. Planets circle around the Sun, and things fall, because space around them is curved figure ..Figure . The Earth turns around the Sun because spacetime around the Sun is curved, rather like a bead which rolls on the curved wall of a funnel.A little more precisely, what curves is not space but spacetime that spacetime which, ten years previously, Einstein himself had shown to be a structured whole rather than a succession of instants.This is the idea. Einsteins only problem was to find the equations to make it concrete. How to describe this bending of spacetime And here Einstein is lucky: the problem had already been solved by the mathematicians.The greatest mathematician of the nineteenth century, Carl Friedrich Gauss, the prince of mathematicians, had written maths to describe curved surfaces, such as the surfaces of hills, or such as the one portrayed in figure ..Figure . A curved bidimensional surface.Then he had asked a talented student of his to generalize this maths to curved spaces in three or more dimensions. The student, Bernhard Riemann, produced a ponderous doctoral thesis of the kind that seems completely useless.Riemanns result was that the properties of a curved space or spacetime in any dimension are described by a particular mathematical object, which we now call Riemann curvature and indicate with the letter . If you think of a landscape of plains, hills and mountains, the curvature R of the surface is zero in the plains, which are flat without curvature and different from zero where there are valleys and hills it is at its maximum where there are pointed peaks of mountains, that is to say, where the ground is least flat, or most curved. Using Riemanns theory, it is possible to describe the shape of curved spaces in three or four dimensions.With a great deal of effort, seeking help from friends better versed in mathematics than himself, Einstein learns Riemanns maths and writes an equation where R is proportional to the energy of matter. In words: spacetime curves more where there is matter. That is it. The equation is the analogue of the Maxwell equations, but for gravity rather than electricity. The equation fits into half a line, and there is nothing more. A vision that space curves becomes an equation.But within this equation there is a teeming universe. And here the magical richness of the theory opens up into a phantasmagorical succession of predictions that resemble the delirious ravings of a madman but which have all turned out to be true. Even up to the beginning of the s, almost nobody took the majority of these fantastical predictions entirely seriously. And yet, one after another, they have all been verified by experience. Lets consider a few of them.To begin with, Einstein recalculates the effect of a mass like the Sun on the curvature of the space that surrounds it, and the effect of this curvature on the movements of the planets. He finds the movements of the planets as predicted by Keplers and Newtons equations, but not exactly: in the vicinity of the Sun, the effect of the curvature of space is stronger than the effect of Newtons force. Einstein computes the movement of Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun and hence the one for which the discrepancy between the predictions of his and Newtons theories is greatest. He finds a difference: the point of the orbit of Mercury closest to the Sun moves every year . seconds of arc more than that predicted by Newtons theory. It is a small difference, but, within the scope of what astronomers were able to measure, and comparing the predictions with the observations of astronomers, the verdict is unequivocal: Mercury follows the trajectory predicted by Einstein, not the one predicted by Newton. Mercury, the fleetfooted messenger of the gods, the god of the winged sandals, follows Einstein, not Newton.Einsteins equation, then, describes how space curves very close to a star. Due to this curvature, light deviates. Einstein predicts that the Sun causes light to curve around it. In the measurement is achieved a deviation of light is measured which turns out to be exactly in accordance with the prediction.But it is not only space that curves: time does, too. Einstein predicts that time on Earth passes more quickly at higher altitude, and more slowly at lower altitude. This is measured, and also proves to be the case. Today we have extremely precise clocks, in many laboratories, and it is possible to measure this strange effect even for a difference in altitude of just a few centimetres. Place a watch on the floor and another on a table: the one on the floor registers less passing of time than the one on the table. Why Because time is not universal and fixed, it is something which expands and shrinks, according to the vicinity of masses: the Earth, like all masses, distorts spacetime, slowing time down in its vicinity. Only slightly but two twins who have lived respectively at sealevel and in the mountains will find that, when they meet up again, one will have aged more than the other figure ..This effect offers an interesting explanation as to why things fall. If you look at a map of the world and the route taken by an aeroplane flying from Rome to New York, it does not seem to be straight: the aeroplane makes an arc towards the north. Why Because, the Earth being curved, crossing northwards is shorter than keeping to the same parallel. The distances between meridians are shorter the more northerly you are therefore, it is better to head northwards, to shorten the route figure ..Well, believe it or not, a ball thrown upwards falls downwards for the same reason: it gains time moving higher up, because time passes at a different speed up there. In both cases, aeroplane and ball follow a straight trajectory in a space or spacetime that is curved figure ..fnFigure . Two twins spend their time one at sealevel and the other in the mountains. When they meet up again, the twin who lived in the mountains is older. This is the gravitational dilation of time.But the predictions of the theory go well beyond these minute effects. Stars burn as long as they have available hydrogen their fuel then die out. The remaining material is no longer supported by the pressure of the heat and collapses under its own weight. When this happens to a large enough star, the weight is so strong that matter is squashed down to an enormous degree and space curves so intensely as to plunge down into an actual hole. A black hole.Figure . The further north you go, the smaller the distance between two meridians.Figure . The higher up something is, the more quickly time passes for it.When I was a university student, black holes were regarded as a scarcely credible implication of an esoteric theory. Today they are observed in their hundreds and studied in detail by astronomers. One of these black holes, with a mass a million times greater than the Sun, is located at the centre of our galaxy we can observe stars orbiting around it. Some, passing too close, are destroyed by its violent gravity.Further still, the theory predicts that space ripples like the surface of the sea, and that these ripples are waves similar to the electromagnetic ones which make television possible. The effects of these gravitational waves can be observed in the sky on binary stars: they radiate such waves, losing energy and slowly falling towards each other.fn Gravitational waves produced by two black holes falling into one another were directly observed by an antenna on Earth in late , and the announcement, given in early , has once again left the world speechless. Once more, the seemingly mad predictions of Einsteins theory turn out to be precisely true.And further still, the theory predicts that the universe is expanding and emerged from a cosmic explosion billion years ago a subject I will discuss in more detail shortly.This rich and complex range of phenomena bending of rays of light, modification of Newtons force, slowing down of clocks, black holes, gravitational waves, expansion of the universe, the Big Bang follow from understanding that space is not a dull, fixed container but possesses its own dynamic, its own physics, just like the matter and the other fields it contains. Democritus himself would have smiled with pleasure, had he been able to see that his idea of space would turn out to have such an impressive future. It is true that he termed it nonbeing, but what he meant by being was matter and he wrote that his nonbeing, the void, nevertheless has a certain physics and a substantiality of its own.fn How right he was.Without the notion of fields introduced by Faraday, without the spectacular power of mathematics, without the geometry of Gauss and Riemann, this certain physics would have remained incomprehensible. Empowered by new conceptual tools and by mathematics, Einstein writes the equations which describe Democrituss void and finds for its certain physics a colourful and amazing world where universes explode, space collapses into bottomless holes, time slows down in the vicinity of a planet, and the boundless expanses of interstellar space ripple and sway like the surface of the sea All of this sounds like a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. And yet, instead, it is a glance towards reality. Or better, a glimpse of reality, a little less veiled than our blurred and banal everyday view of it. A reality which seems to be made of the same stuff our dreams are made of, but which is nevertheless more real than our clouded daily dreaming.And all this is the result only of an elementary intuition that spacetime and the gravitational field are one and the same thing and a simple equation which I cant resist copying out here, even if most of my readers will certainly not be able to decipher it. I do so, anyway, in the hope that they might be able to catch a glimpse of its beautiful simplicity:In the equation was simpler still, because the term gab, which Einstein added two years later and which I discuss below did not yet exist.fn Rab depends on Riemanns curvature, and together with Rgab represents the curvature of spacetime Tab stands for the energy of matter G is the same constant that Newton found: the constant that determines the strength of the force of gravity.Thats it. A vision and an equation.Mathematics or physicsI would like to pause, before continuing with physics, to make a few observations about mathematics. Einstein was no great mathematician. He struggled with maths. He says this himself. In he replied in the following way to a nineyearold child with the name of Barbara who wrote to him about her difficulties with the subject: Dont worry about experiencing difficulties with maths, I can assure you that my own problems are even more serious! It seems like a joke, but Einstein was not kidding. With mathematics, he needed help: he had it explained to him by patient fellow students and friends, such as Marcel Grossman. It was his intuition as a physicist that was prodigious.During the last year in which he was completing the construction of his theory, Einstein found himself competing with David Hilbert, one of the greatest mathematicians of all time. Einstein had given a lecture, attended by Hilbert, in Gttingen. Hilbert immediately understood that Einstein was in the process of making a major discovery, grasped the idea and tried to overtake Einstein and be the first to write the correct equations of the new theory Einstein was slowly building. The sprint to the finish line between the two giants was a nailbiting affair, eventually decided by a matter of just a few days. Einstein, in Berlin, ended up giving a public lecture almost every week, each time presenting a different equation, anxious that Hilbert would not get to the solution before him. The equation was incorrect every time. Until, that is, by a hairs breadth just marginally ahead of Hilbert Einstein found the right one. He had won the race.Hilbert, a gentleman, never questioned Einsteins victory, even though he was working on very similar equations at the time. In fact, he left a gentle and beautiful phrase which captures perfectly Einsteins difficult relationship with mathematics, and, perhaps, the difficult relationship which exists generally between the whole of physics and mathematics. The maths that was necessary to formulate the theory was geometry in four dimensions, and Hilbert writes:Any youngster on the streets of Gttingenfn understands geometry in four dimensions better than Einstein. And yet, it was Einstein who completed the task.Why Because Einstein had a unique capacity to imagine how the world might be constructed, to see it in his mind. The equations, for him, came afterwards they were the language with which to make concrete his visions of reality. For Einstein, the theory of general relativity is not a collection of equations: it is a mental image of the world arduously translated into equations.The idea behind the theory is that spacetime curves. If spacetime had only two dimensions, and we lived on a sort of plane, it would be easy to imagine what it means to say that physical space curves. It would mean that the physical space in which we live is not like a flat table but resembles instead a surface with mountains and valleys. But the world we inhabit does not have only two dimensions, it has three. Four, in fact, when time is included. To imagine a curved space in four dimensions is more complicated, because in our habitual perception we do not have an intuition of a larger space within which spacetime can curve. But Einsteins imagination had no difficulty in intuiting the cosmic mollusc in which we are immersed, which can be squashed, stretched and twisted and that constitutes the spacetime around us. It is thanks to this visionary clarity that Einstein managed to be the first to write the theory.In the end, a degree of tension between Hilbert and Einstein did develop. A few days before Einstein made his successful equation public, Hilbert had sent an article to a periodical which shows just how close he had come to the same solution and even today historians of science are faced with doubts when trying to evaluate the respective contributions of these two giants. At some point their relations cooled, and Einstein feared that Hilbert, more senior and powerful than him, would seek to attribute to himself too much of the merit for the construction of the theory. But Hilbert never claimed to be the first to discover general relativity and in a world such as that of science, where often, too frequently, disputes over precedence become poisonous the two gave a truly wonderful example of wisdom, clearing the field of all negative tension.Einstein writes a marvellous letter to Hilbert, summarizing the profound sense of the shared course they had taken:There was a moment in which something like an irritation came between us, the origin of which I no longer want to analyse. I have fought against the bitterness which it provoked in me, and have succeeded completely in doing so. I again think of you with unclouded friendship, and I ask you to do the same for me. It is really a pity if companions such as we are, who have managed to forge a path aside from the pettiness of this world, could find anything other than joy in each others company.The cosmosTwo years after the publication of his equation, Einstein decides to use it to describe the space of the entire universe, considered at the largest scale. And here he has another of his amazing ideas.For thousands of years, men had asked themselves whether the universe was infinite, or had a limit. Both hypotheses entail thorny problems. An infinite universe does not seem to stand to reason: if it is infinite, for example, there must exist somewhere a reader just like you who is reading the very same book infinity is truly vast, and there are not sufficient combinations of atoms to fill it with things always different from each other. In fact, there must be not only one but an infinite series of readers identical to yourself But if there is a limit to the universe, what is that boundary What sense is there in a border with nothing on the other side Already in the fourth century , in Taranto, the Pythagorean philosopher Archytas had written:If I found myself in the furthest sky, that of the fixed stars, would I be able to stretch my hand, or a rod, out beyond it or not That I should not be able to is absurd but if I am able to, then an outside exists, be it of matter, or space. In this way one could proceed ever further, towards the end, from time to time asking the same question, as to whether there will always be something into which to extend the rod.These two absurd alternatives the absurdity of an infinite space, and the absurdity of a universe with a fixed border didnt seem to leave any reasonable choice between them.But Einstein finds a third way: the universe can be finite and at the same time have no boundary. How Just as the surface of the Earth is not infinite but does not have a boundary either, where it ends. This can happen, naturally enough, if something is curved: the surface of the Earth is curved. And in the theory of general relativity, of course, threedimensional space can also be curved. Consequently, our universe can be finite but borderless.On the surface of the Earth, if I were to keep walking in a straight line, I would not advance ad infinitum: I would eventually get back to the point I started from. Our universe could be made in the same way: if I leave in a spacecraft and journey always in the same direction, I fly around the universe and eventually end up back on Earth. A threedimensional space of this kind, finite but without boundary, is called a sphere.Figure . A sphere can be represented as two discs which in reality are smoothly joined all along their edges.To understand the geometry of a sphere, let us return to the ordinary sphere the surface of a ball, or the Earth. To represent the surface of the Earth on a plane, we can draw two discs, as is customary when drawing the continents figure ..Notice that an inhabitant of the southern hemisphere is in a certain sense surrounded by the northern hemisphere, since in whichever direction she goes to exit her hemisphere, she will always arrive in the other one. But the contrary is obviously true as well: each hemisphere surrounds, and is surrounded by, the other. A sphere may be represented in a similar fashion, but with everything given an additional dimension: two balls stuck together all along their edges figure ..When we leave one ball we enter into the other, just as when we leave one of the discs in the representation of the globe we enter into the other disc. Each ball surrounds and is surrounded by the other. Einsteins idea is that space could be a sphere: something with a finite volume the sum of the volume of the two balls, but without borders.fn The sphere is the solution which Einstein proposes in his work of to the problem of the border of the universe. This article initiates modern cosmology, the study of the entire visible universe, studied at the grandest scale. From it will arise the discovery of the expansion of the universe the theory of the Big Bang the problem of the birth of the universe, and much else besides. I speak about all of this in Chapter .Figure . A sphere can be represented as two balls joined together.There is one more observation which I would like to make about Einsteins sphere. However incredible it might seem, the same idea had already been conceived by another genius, from an entirely different cultural universe: Dante Alighieri, Italys greatest poet. In the Paradiso, the third part of his major poem, the Commedia, Dante offers a grandiose vision of the medieval world, calqued on the world of Aristotle, with the spherical Earth at its centre, surrounded by the celestial spheres figure ..Figure . Traditional representation of Dantes universe.Accompanied by his shining loved one, Beatrice, Dante ascends these spheres in the course of a fantastic, visionary journey up to the outermost sphere. When he reaches it, he contemplates the universe below him with its rotating heavens and the Earth, very far down, at its centre. But then he looks even higher and what does he see He sees a point of light surrounded by immense spheres of angels, that is to say, by another immense ball, which, in his words surrounds and is at the same time surrounded by the sphere of our universe! Here are Dantes verses from Canto I of the Paradiso. Questa altre parte dellUniverso dun cerchio lui comprende si come questo li altri: This other part of the universe surrounds the first in a circle like the first surrounds the others. And in the next canto, still on the last circle, parendo inchiuso da quel chelli inchiude: appearing to be to be enclosed by those that it encloses. The point of light and the sphere of angels are surrounding the universe, and at the same time they are surrounded by the universe! It is an exact description of a sphere!The usual representations of Dantes universe common in Italian schoolbooks such as figure . place the angelic spheres separate from the celestial ones. But Dante writes that the two balls surround and are surrounded by each other. Dante has a clear geometrical intuition of a sphere.fnThe first to notice that the Paradiso describes the universe as a sphere was an American mathematician, Mark Peterson, in . In general, scholars of Dante are not very familiar with spheres. Today, every physicist and mathematician could easily recognize the sphere in Dantes description of the universe.How is it possible that Dante had an idea that sounds so modern I think it was possible, in the first place, due to the profound intelligence of Italys finest poet. This intelligence is one of the reasons why the Commedia is so fascinating. But it is also due to the fact that Dante was writing well before Newton convinced everyone that the infinite space of the cosmos was the flat one of Euclidean geometry. Dante was free of the restraints upon our intuition we have as a result of our Newtonian schooling.Dantes scientific culture was based principally on the teachings of his mentor and tutor, Brunetto Latini, who has left us a small, enchanting treatise, Li tresor, which is a sort of encyclopaedia of medieval knowledge, written in a delightful combination of old French and Italian. In Li tresor, Brunetto explains in detail the fact that the Earth is round. But he does so, curiously to the eyes of a modern reader, in terms of intrinsic rather than extrinsic geometry. That is to say, he does not write, the Earth is like an orange, as the Earth would look if seen from the outside, but writes instead, Two knights who could gallop sufficiently far in opposite directions would meet up on the other side. And: If he were not impeded by the seas, a man who set out to walk for ever would return to the point on the Earth from which he departed. In other words, he adopts an internal, not an external, point of view: the perspective of someone who walks the Earth, not of someone who looks at it from afar. At first glance it might seem like a pointless, complicated way of explaining that the Earth is a ball. Why doesnt Brunetto simply say that the Earth is like an orange But, on reflection: if, say, an ant walks on an orange, it will at some point find itself upside down, and must keep itself attached by means of the tiny suction pads on its legs, to avoid falling off. And yet a traveller who walks the Earth never finds himself upside down, and needs no suction pads on his legs. Brunettos description is not so quaint after all.Now, think about it. For someone who has learned from his teacher that the form of the surface of our planet is such that by walking always in a straight line we return to the point we started from, it is perhaps not so difficult to take the next obvious step, and imagine that the form of the entire universe is such that, flying always in a straight line, we return to the same point of departure: a sphere is a space in which two winged knights that could fly in opposite directions would meet up on the other side. In technical terms, the description of the geometry of the Earth offered by Brunetto Latini in Li tresor is given in terms of intrinsic geometry seen from the inside rather than extrinsic seen from the outside, and this is exactly the description that is suitable to generalize the notion of sphere from two dimensions to three. The best way of describing a sphere is not to try to see it from the outside, but rather to describe what happens when moving within it.The method developed by Gauss to describe curved surfaces, and generalized by Riemann to describe the curvature of spaces in three or more dimensions, basically, amounts to Brunetto Latinis way. That is to say, the idea is to describe a curved space not as seen from the outside, stating how it curves in an external space, but instead in terms of what may be experienced by somebody within that space, who is moving and always remaining within it. For instance, the surface of an ordinary sphere, as Brunetto observes, is a surface where all the straight lines get back to the starting point after traversing the same distance the length of the equator. A sphere is a threedimensional space with the same property.Einsteins spacetime is not curved in the sense that it curves in an external space. It is curved in the sense that its intrinsic geometry, that is to say, the web of distances between its points, which can be observed by staying within it, is not the geometry of a flat space. It is a space where Pythagorass theorem is not valid, just as Pythagorass theorem is not valid on the surface of the Earth.fnThere is a way of understanding the curvature of space from within it, and without looking at it from outside, which is important for what follows. Imagine you are at the North Pole and walk southwards until you reach the equator, carrying with you an arrow pointing ahead. Once you reach the equator, turn to the left without changing the direction of the arrow. The arrow still points south, which is now to your right. Advance a little towards the east along the equator and then turn again towards the north again without changing the direction of the arrow, which will now be pointing behind you. When you reach the North Pole again, you have executed a closed circuit a loop, as it is termed and the arrow does not point in the same direction as when you started out figure .. The angle through which the arrow has turned in the course of the loop measures the curvature.I will return later to this method of measuring curvature by making a loop in space. These will be the loops that give the name to the theory of loop quantum gravity.Figure . An arrow carried parallel to itself along a circuit a loop in a curved space arrives back rotated at the point of departure.Dante leaves Florence in , while the mosaics in the cupola of the Baptistery are being completed. The mosaic, representing Hell the work of Coppo di Marcovaldo, the teacher of Cimabue, probably terrifying in the eyes of a medieval person, has often been indicated as a source of inspiration to Dante figure ..Shortly before starting to write this book, I visited the Baptistery in the company of Emanuela Minnai, the friend who convinced me to write it. Entering the Baptistery and looking up, you see a shining point of light the light source from the lantern at the summit of the cupola surrounded by nine orders of angels, with the name of each order written: Angels, Archangels, Principalities, Powers, Virtues, Domains, Thrones, Cherubim and Seraphim. This corresponds exactly to the structure of the second sphere of Paradise. Imagine that you are an ant on the floor of the Baptistery and are able to walk in any direction regardless of which direction you follow to climb the wall, you would reach the ceiling at the same point of light surrounded by angels: the point of light and its angels both surround and are surrounded by the rest of the decorated interior of the Baptistery figure ..Figure . The mosaic depicting Hell, by Coppo di Marcovaldo, in the Baptistery of Florence.Like every citizen of Florence at the end of the thirteenth century, Dante must have been profoundly awestruck by the Baptistery, the grandiose architectural enterprise his city was completing. I believe that he may have been inspired by the Baptistery, not only by Coppo di Marcovaldos Inferno, but also by its overall architecture, for his vision of the cosmos. The Paradiso reproduces its structure remarkably precisely, including the nine circles of angels and the point of light, just translating it from two to three dimensions. After describing the spherical universe of Aristotle, Brunetto had already written that beyond it lies the place of divinity and medieval iconography had already imagined Paradise as God surrounded by spheres of angels. In the end, Dante does no more than mount the pieces that already existed into a coherent architectural whole which follows the suggestive architecture of the Baptistery and resolves the ancient problem of the borders of the universe. In so doing, Dante anticipates by six centuries Einsteins sphere.Figure . The interior of the Baptistery.I dont know if the young Einstein had encountered the Paradiso during his intellectual wanderings in Italy, and whether or not the vivid imagination of the Italian poet may have had a direct influence on his intuition that the universe might be both finite and without boundary. Whether or not such influence occurred, I believe that this example demonstrates how great science and great poetry are both visionary, and may even arrive at the same intuitions. Our culture is foolish to keep science and poetry separated: they are two tools to open our eyes to the complexity and beauty of the world.Dantes sphere is only an intuition within a dream. Einsteins sphere has mathematical form and follows from the theorys equations. The effect of each is different. Dante moves us deeply, touching the sources of our emotions. Einstein opens a road towards the unsolved mysteries of our universe. But both count among the most beautiful and significant flights that the mind can achieve.But lets return to , when Einstein tries to insert the idea of the sphere into his equations. Here he encounters a problem. He is convinced that the universe is fixed and immutable, but his equations tell him that this is not possible. It isnt difficult to understand why. Everything attracts, therefore the only way for a finite universe not to collapse on itself is for it to be expanding: just as the only way to prevent a football from falling to the ground is to kick it upwards. It either goes up, or falls down it cant stay still, suspended in the air.But Einstein does not believe what his own equations are telling him. He even makes a silly physics mistake he does not realize that the solution he considers is unstable just to avoid accepting what his theory predicts: the universe is either contracting or expanding. He modifies his equations, trying to avoid the implication that it is expanding. It is for this reason that he adds the term gab in the equation written above. But it is a further mistake: the added term is correct, but it does not change the fact that the equation predicts that the universe must be expanding. For all his bravery, Einstein the genius lacks the courage to believe his own equations.A few years later Einstein is forced to give up: it is his theory that is right, not his reservations about it. Astronomers realize that all galaxies are indeed moving away from us. The universe is expanding, exactly as the equations predicted. Fourteen billion years ago, the universe was concentrated almost to a single, furiously hot point. From there it expanded in a colossal cosmic explosion and here the term cosmic is not used in any rhetorical sense: it is, literally, a cosmic explosion. This is the Big Bang.Today we know the expansion is real. The definitive proof of the scenario foreseen by Einsteins equations arrives in , when two American radioastronomers, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, discover by accident a radiation diffused throughout the universe which turns out to be precisely what remains of the original immense heat of the early universe. Once again, the theory turns out to have been correct, up to its most amazing predictions.Figure . Einsteins world: particles and fields which move on other fields.Ever since we discovered that the Earth is round and turns like a mad spinningtop, we have understood that reality is not what it seems: every time we glimpse a new aspect of it, it is a deeply emotional experience. Another veil has fallen. But the leap made by Einstein is unparalleled: spacetime is a field the world is made only of fields and particles space and time are not something else, something different from the rest of nature: they are just a field among the others figure ..In , a primary schoolchild writes to Albert Einstein, Our class is studying the universe. I am very interested in space. I would like to thank you for all that you have done so that we might understand it.I feel the same way.. QuantaThe two pillars of twentiethcentury physics general relativity and quantum mechanics could not be more different from each other. General relativity is a compact jewel: conceived by a single mind, based on combining previous theories, it is a simple and coherent vision of gravity, space and time. Quantum mechanics, or quantum theory, on the other hand, emerges from experiments in the course of a long gestation over a quarter of a century, to which many have contributed achieves unequalled experimental success and leads to applications which have transformed our everyday lives the computer on which I write, for instance but, more than a century after its birth, it remains shrouded in obscurity and incomprehensibility.This chapter illustrates the strange physics of this theory, relates how the theory came into being and the three aspects of reality it has unveiled: granularity, indeterminism and relationality.Albert againIts said that quantum mechanics was born precisely in , virtually ushering in a century of intense thought. In the German physicist Max Planck tries to compute the amount of electromagnetic waves in equilibrium in a hot box. To obtain a formula reproducing the experimental results, he ends up using a trick which does not appear to make much sense: he assumes that the energy of the electric field is distributed in quanta, that is to say, in small packets, little bricks of energy. The size of the packets, he assumes, depends on the frequency that is, the colour of the electromagnetic waves. For waves of frequency , every quantum, or every packet, has energyE hThis formula is the first of quantum mechanics h is a novel constant which today we call the Planck constant. It fixes how much energy there is in each packet of energy, for radiation of frequency colour . The constant h determines the scale of all quantum phenomena.The idea that energy could be made up of finite packets is at odds with everything that was known at the time: energy was considered something that could vary in a continuous manner, and there was no reason to treat it as if it were made up of grains. For example, the energy of a pendulum measures the amplitude of the swing. There seems to be no reason for a pendulum to oscillate only with certain determined amplitudes and not others. For Max Planck, taking energy in finitesize packets was only a strange trick which happened to work for the calculation that is, to reproduce laboratory measurements but for utterly unclear reasons.Five years later it is Albert Einstein him again who comes to understand that Plancks packets of energy are in fact real. This is the subject of the third of the three articles sent to the Annalen der Physik in . And this is the true date of birth of quantum theory.In the article, Einstein argues that light truly is made up of small grains, particles of light. He considers a phenomenon that had been recently observed: the photoelectric effect. There are substances that generate a weak electric current when struck by light. That is to say, they emit electrons when light shines on them. Today we use them, for example, in the photoelectric cells which open doors when we approach them by detecting if light arrives, or not, in a sensor. That this happens is not strange, because light carries energy it warms us, for example, and its energy makes the electrons jump out of their atoms it gives them a push.But something is strange: it seems reasonable to expect that if the energy of light is scarce namely, if the light is dim the phenomenon would not take place and that it would take place when the energy is sufficient namely, when the light is bright. But it isnt like this: what is observed is that the phenomenon happens only if the frequency of light is high and does not happen if the frequency is low. That is to say, it happens or doesnt happen depending on the colour of light the frequency rather than its intensity energy. There is no way of making sense of this with standard physics.Einstein uses Plancks idea of the packets of energy, with a size that depends upon frequency, and realizes that if these packets are real, the phenomenon can be explained. It isnt difficult to understand why. Imagine that the light arrives in the form of grains of energy. An electron will be swept out of its atom if the individual grain hitting it has a great deal of energy. What matters is the energy of each grain, not the number of grains. If, as in Plancks hypothesis, the energy of each grain is determined by frequency, the phenomenon will occur only if frequency is sufficiently high, that is to say, if the individual grains of energy are sufficiently large, independently from the total amount of energy thats around.It is like when it hails: what determines whether your car will be dented is not the total quantity of hail that falls but the size of the individual hailstones. There could be an enormous amount of hail, but it will do no damage if all the stones are small. In the same way, even if light is intense which amounts to saying that there are a great deal of light packets the electrons would not be extracted from their atoms if the individual grains of light are too small, that is, if the frequency of light is too low. This explains why it is the colour and not the intensity which determines whether the photoelectric effect occurs or not. For this simple reasoning Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize. It is easy to understand things once someone has thought them through. The difficulty lies in thinking them through in the first place.Today we call these packets of energy photons, from the Greek word for light: . Photons are the grains of light, its quanta. In the article Einstein writes:It seems to me that the observations associated with blackbody radiation, fluorescence, the production of cathode rays by ultraviolet light, and other related phenomena connected with the emission or transformation of light are more readily understood if one assumes that the energy of light is discontinuously distributed in space. In accordance with the assumption to be considered here, the energy of a light ray spreading out from a point source is not continuously distributed over an increasing space but consists of a finite number of energy quanta which are localized at points in space, which move without dividing, and which can only be produced and absorbed as complete units.These simple and clear lines are the real birth certificate of quantum theory. Note the wonderful initial It seems to me , which recalls the hesitations of Faraday, or those of Newton or the uncertainty of Darwin in the first pages of On the Origin of Species. True genius is aware of the momentousness of the steps it is taking, and is always hesitant There is a clear relation between Einsteins work on Brownian motion discussed in Chapter and his work on the quanta of light, both completed in . In the first, Einstein had managed to find a demonstration of the atomic hypothesis, that is to say, of the granular structure of matter. In the second he extends this same hypothesis to light: light must have a granular structure as well.At first, Einsteins idea that light could be made up of photons is regarded by his colleagues as no more than youthful waywardness. Everyone commends him for his theory of relativity, but everybody judges the notion of photons to be outlandish. Scientists had only recently been persuaded that light was a wave in the electromagnetic field: how could it be made up of grains In a letter addressed to the German Ministry, recommending that Einstein should have a professorship inaugurated for him in Berlin, the most distinguished physicists of the day write that the young man is so brilliant that he may be excused certain excesses, such as the idea of photons. Not many years later, the very same colleagues award him the Nobel Prize, precisely for having understood that photons exist. Light falls on a surface like a gentle hail shower.To comprehend how light may be simultaneously an electromagnetic wave and a swarm of photons will require the entire construction of quantum mechanics. But the first building block of this theory has been established: there exists a fundamental granularity in all things, including light.Niels, Werner and PaulIf Planck is the biological father of the theory, Einstein is the parent who gave birth to and nurtured it. But as is often the case with children, the theory then went its own way, barely recognized by Einstein as his own.During the first two decades of the twentieth century, it is the Dane Niels Bohr who is responsible for guiding its development. Bohr studies the structure of atoms, which was beginning to be explored at the turn of the century. Experiments had shown that an atom is like a small solar system: the mass is concentrated in a heavy central nucleus, around which light electrons revolve, more or less like the planets around the Sun. This picture, however, did not account for a simple fact: matter is coloured.Salt is white, pepper is black, chilli is red. Why Studying the light emitted by atoms, it is apparent that substances have specific colours. Since colour is the frequency of light, light is emitted by substances at certain fixed frequencies. The set of the frequencies that characterizes a given substance is known as the spectrum of this substance. A spectrum is a collection of fine lines of different hues, in which the light emitted by a given substance is decomposed for instance, by a prism. The spectra of a few elements are shown in figure ..Figure . Niels Bohr.Spectra of numerous substances had been studied and catalogued in many laboratories at the turn of the century, and nobody knew how to explain why each substance had this or that spectrum. What determines the colour of those linesFigure . The spectra of some elements: sodium, mercury, lithium and hydrogen.Colour is the speed at which Faradays lines vibrate, and this is determined by the vibrations of the electric charges which emit light. These charges are the electrons that move inside the atoms. Therefore, studying spectra, we can understand how electrons move around nuclei. The other way around, we could predict the spectrum of each atom by computing the frequencies of the electrons circling their nucleus. Easy to say, but in practice nobody was able to do so. In fact, the whole thing seemed impossible, because in Newtons mechanics an electron can revolve around its nucleus at any speed, and hence emit light at any frequency. But then why does the light emitted by an atom not contain all colours, rather than just a few particular ones Why are atomic spectra not a continuum of colours, instead of just a few separate lines Why, in technical parlance, are they discrete instead of continuous For decades, physicists seemed incapable of finding an answer.Bohr finds a tentative solution, by way of a strange hypothesis. He realizes that everything could be explained if the energy of electrons in atoms could only assume certain quantized values certain specific values, just as was hypothesized by Planck and by Einstein for the energy of the quanta of light. Once again, the key is a granularity, but not now for the energy of light but rather for the energy of the electrons in the atom. It begins to become clear that granularity is something widespread in nature.Bohr makes the hypothesis that electrons can exist only at certain special distances from the nucleus, that is, only on certain particular orbits, the scale of which is determined by Plancks constant h. And that electrons can leap between one orbit with the permitted energy to another. These are the famous quantum leaps. The frequency at which the electron moves on these orbits determines the frequency of the emitted light and, since only certain orbits are allowed, it follows that only certain frequencies are emitted.These hypotheses define Bohrs atomic model, whose centenary was commemorated in . With these assumptions outlandish, but simple Bohr manages to compute the spectra of all atoms, and even to predict accurately spectra not yet observed. The experimental success of this simple model is astonishing.Clearly, there must be some truth in these assumptions, even if they run contrary to all contemporary notions of matter and dynamics. But why are there always only just certain orbits And what does it mean to say that electrons leapIn Bohrs institute in Copenhagen, the most brilliant young minds of the century gather to try to give order to this jumble of incomprehensible behaviours in the atomic world, and to construct a coherent theory. The research is arduous and protracted, until a young German finds the key to unlock the door of the mystery of the quantum world.Werner Heisenberg is twentyfive years old when he writes the equations of quantum mechanics, the same age as Einstein was when he wrote his three major articles. He does so on the basis of dizzying ideas.Figure . Werner Heisenberg.The intuition comes to him one night in the park behind the Copenhagen Institute of Physics. The young Werner walks about pensively in the park. It is really dark there we are in . There is only an occasional streetlamp, casting dim islands of light here and there. The pools of light are separated by large expanses of darkness. Suddenly, Heisenberg sees a figure pass by. Actually, he does not see him pass: he sees him appear beneath a lamp, then disappear into the dark before reappearing beneath another lamp, and then vanishing back into the dark again. And so on, from pool of light to pool of light, until he eventually disappears altogether into the night. Heisenberg thinks that, evidently, the man does not actually vanish and reappear: in his mind, he can easily reconstruct the mans trajectory between one streetlamp and another. After all, a man is a substantial object, big and heavy and big, heavy objects do not simply appear and vanish Ah! These objects, which are substantial, large and heavy, dont vanish and reappear but what do we know about electrons A light flashes on in his mind. Why should small objects such as electrons do the same What if, effectively, electrons could vanish and reappear What if these were the mysterious quantum leaps which appeared to underlie the structure of the atomic spectra What if, between one interaction with something, and another with something else, the electron could literally be nowhere.What if the electron could be something that manifests itself only when it interacts, when it collides with something else and that between one interaction and another it had no precise position What if always having a precise position is something which is acquired only if one is substantial enough large and heavy like the man that passed by a little while ago, like a ghost in the dark, and then disappeared into the night Only someone in his twenties can take such delirious propositions seriously. You have to be a twentysomething to believe that they can be turned into a theory of the world. And perhaps you have to be this young to understand better than anyone else, for the first time, the deep structure of nature. Just as Einstein was in his twenties when he realized that time does not pass in the same way for everyone, so, too, was Heisenberg on that Copenhagen night. Perhaps, it is no longer a good idea to trust your intuitions after the age of thirty Heisenberg returns home gripped by feverish emotion, and plunges into calculations. He emerges, some time later, with a disconcerting theory: a fundamental description of the movement of particles, in which they are described not by their position at every moment but only by their position at particular instants: the instants in which they interact with something else.This is the second cornerstone of quantum mechanics, its hardest key: the relational aspect of things. Electrons dont always exist. They exist when they interact. They materialize in a place when they collide with something else. The quantum leaps from one orbit to another constitute their way of being real: an electron is a combination of leaps from one interaction to another. When nothing disturbs it, an electron does not exist in any place. Instead of writing the position and velocity of the electron, Heisenberg writes tables of numbers matrices. He multiplies and divides tables of numbers representing possible interactions of the electron. And, as if from the magical abacus of a magus, the results correspond exactly with what was observed. These are the first fundamental equations of quantum mechanics. From here on, these equations will do nothing but work, work, work. Up until now, incredible as it may seem, they have never failed.In the end, it is another twentyfiveyearold who picks up the work initiated by Heisenberg, takes the new theory in his hands and constructs its entire formal and mathematical scaffolding: the Englishman Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac, considered by many to be the greatest physicist of the twentieth century after Einstein.Despite his scientific stature, Dirac is much less wellknown than Einstein. This is due, in part, to the rarefied abstraction of his science, and partly due to his disconcerting character. Silent in company, extremely reserved, incapable of expressing emotions, frequently unable to recognize the faces of acquaintances incapable even of conducting an ordinary conversation, or of, apparently, understanding simple questions he seemed virtually autistic, and perhaps fell within the spectrum of this condition.Figure . Paul Dirac.During one of his lectures, a colleague said to him, I dont understand that formula. After a short, silent pause, Dirac continued on regardless. The moderator interrupted him, asking if he would like to reply to the question. Dirac, sincerely astonished, replied, Question What question My colleague has made an assertion. And so, in a very pedantic sense, he had. It wasnt arrogance: the man who could discover secrets of nature which had eluded everyone else could not understand the implicit meaning of language, could not grasp its nonliteral usage, and took every phrase at face value. And yet, in his hands, quantum mechanics is transformed from a jumble of intuitions, halfbaked calculations, misty metaphysical discussions and equations that work well, but inexplicably, into a perfect architecture: airy, simple and extremely beautiful. Beautiful, but stratospherically abstract.The venerable Bohr said of him, Of all physicists, Dirac has the purest soul. And dont his eyes, in figure . show so His physics has the pristine clarity of a song. For him, the world is not made of things, its constituted of an abstract mathematical structure which shows us how things appear and how they behave when manifesting themselves. Its a magical encounter between logic and intuition. Deeply impressed, Einstein remarked, Dirac poses problems for me. To maintain an equilibrium along this vertiginous course, between genius and madness, is a daunting enterprise.Diracs quantum mechanics is the mathematical theory used today by any engineer, chemist or molecular biologist. In it, every object is defined by an abstract spacefn and has no property in itself, apart from those that are unchanging, such as mass. Its position and velocity, its angular momentum and its electrical potential, and so on, acquire reality only when it collides interacts with another object. It is not just its position which is undefined, as Heisenberg had recognized: no variable of the object is defined between one interaction and the next. The relational aspect of the theory becomes universal.When it suddenly appears, in the course of an interaction with another object, a physical variable velocity, energy, momentum, angular momentum does not assume just any value. Dirac provides the general recipe to compute the set of values that a physical variable can take.fn These values are analogous to the spectra of the light emitted by atoms. Today we call the set of the particular values which a variable may assume the spectrum of that variable, by analogy with the spectra into which the light of elements decomposes the first manifestation of this phenomenon. For example, the radius of the orbitals of an electron around a nucleus can acquire only specific values, those that Bohr had hypothesized, which form the spectrum of the radius.The theory also gives information on which value of the spectrum will manifest itself in the next interaction, but only in the form of probabilities. We do not know with certainty where the electron will appear, but we can compute the probability that it will appear here or there. This is a radical change from Newtons theory, where it is possible, in principle, to predict the future with certainty. Quantum mechanics brings probability to the heart of the evolution of things. This indeterminacy is the third cornerstone of quantum mechanics: the discovery that chance operates at the atomic level. While Newtons physics allows for the prediction of the future with exactitude, if we have sufficient information about the initial data and if we can make the calculations, quantum mechanics allows us to calculate only the probability of an event. This absence of determinism at a small scale is intrinsic to nature. An electron is not obliged by nature to move towards the right or the left it does so by chance. The apparent determinism of the macroscopic world is due only to the fact that the microscopic randomness cancels out on average, leaving only fluctuations too minute for us to perceive in everyday life.Diracs quantum mechanics thus allows us to do two things. The first is to calculate which values a physical variable may assume. This is called calculation of the spectrum of a variable it captures the granular nature of things. When an object atom, electromagnetic field, molecule, pendulum, stone, star, and so on interacts with something else, the values computed are those which its variables can assume in the interaction relationism. The second thing that Diracs quantum mechanics allows us to do is to compute the probability that this or that value of a variable appears at the next interaction. This is called calculation of an amplitude of transition. Probability expresses the third feature of the theory: indeterminacy the fact that it does not give unique predictions, only probabilistic ones.This is Diracs quantum mechanics: a recipe for calculating the spectra of the variables and a recipe for calculating the probability that one or another value in the spectrum will appear during an interaction. Thats it. What happens between one interaction and the next is not mentioned in the theory. It does not exist.The probability of finding an electron or any other particle at one point or another can be imagined as a diffuse cloud, denser where the probability of seeing the particle is stronger. Sometimes it is useful to visualize this cloud as if it were a real thing. For instance, the cloud that represents an electron around its nucleus indicates where it is more likely that the electron appears if we look at it. Perhaps you encountered them at school: these are the atomic orbitals.fnThe efficacy of the theory soon proves extraordinary. If today we build computers, have advanced molecular chemistry and biology, lasers and semiconductors, it is thanks to quantum mechanics. For a certain number of decades it was as if it were Christmas every day for physicists: for every new problem, there was an answer which followed from the equations of quantum mechanics, and it was always the correct answer. One example of this will suffice.The matter surrounding us is made up of a thousand different substances. During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries chemists understood that all these different substances are just combinations of a relatively small number less than a hundred of simple elements: hydrogen, helium, oxygen, and so on to uranium. Mendeleev put these elements in order according to weight in the famous periodic table which is pinned to the walls of so many classrooms and which summarizes the properties of the elements of which the world is made not only on Earth but all over the universe in all galaxies. Why these specific elements What explains the periodic structure of the table Why does each element have certain properties and not others Why, for instance, do some elements combine easily, whereas others do not What is the secret of the curious structure of Mendeleevs tableFigure . Light is a wave on a field, but it has also a granular structure.Well, take the equation of quantum mechanics that determines the form of the orbitals of an electron. This equation has a certain number of solutions, and these solutions correspond exactly to hydrogen, helium, oxygen and the other elements! Mendeleevs periodic table is structured exactly like the set of these solutions. The properties of the elements, with everything else, follows from the solution of this equation. Quantum mechanics deciphers perfectly the secret of the structure of the periodic table of elements.Pythagoras and Platos ancient dream is realized: to describe all of the worlds substances with a single formula. The infinite complexity of chemistry, captured by the solutions of a single equation! And this is just one of the applications of quantum mechanics.Fields and particles are the same thingShortly after completing the general formulation of quantum mechanics, Dirac realizes that the theory can be directly applied to fields such as electromagnetic ones, and can be made consistent with special relativity. Making it consistent with general relativity will prove much harder, and is the main subject of this book. In doing this, Dirac discovers an ulterior, profound simplification of our description of nature: the convergence between the notion of particles used by Newton and the notion of fields introduced by Faraday.The cloud of probability which accompanies electrons between one interaction and another does resemble a field. Faraday and Maxwells fields, in turn, are made up of grains: photons. Not only are the particles in a certain sense diffused in space like fields but the fields interact like particles. The notions of fields and particles, separated by Faraday and Maxwell, end up merging in quantum mechanics.The way this happens in the theory is elegant: the equation of Dirac determines the values a variable can take. Applied to the energy of Faradays lines, they tell us that this energy can only take on certain values, and not others. Since the energy of the electromagnetic field can take on only certain values, the field behaves like a set of packets of energy. These are precisely the quanta of energy introduced by Planck and Einstein thirty years earlier. The circle closes, and the story is complete. The equations of the theory, written by Dirac, account for the granular nature of light, which Planck and Einstein had intuited.The electromagnetic waves are vibrations of Faradays lines, but also, at a small scale, swarms of photons. When they interact with something else, as in the photoelectric effect, they manifest themselves as particles: to our eye, light rains in separate droplets, in single photons. Photons are the quanta of the electromagnetic field.But the electrons and all the other particles of which the world is made are equally quanta of a field a quantum field similar to Faraday and Maxwells, subject to granularity and to quantum probability. Dirac writes the equations for the field of the electrons and of the other elementary particles.fn The sharp distinction between fields and particles introduced by Faraday vanishes.The general form of quantum theory compatible with special relativity is thus called quantum field theory, and it forms the basis of todays particle physics. Particles are quanta of a field, just as photons are quanta of light. All fields display a granular structure in their interactions.During the course of the twentieth century the list of fundamental fields was repeatedly updated, and today we have a theory called the standard model of elementary particles which describes almost all we see, with the exception of gravity,fn in the context of quantum field theory. The development of this model occupied physicists for a good part of the last century, and represents in itself a wonderful adventure of discovery. I dont present this side of the story here: it is quantum gravity that I would like to get on to. The standard model is completed by the s. There are approximately fifteen fields, whose quanta are the elementary particles electrons, quarks, muons, neutrinos, Higgs, and little else, plus a few fields similar to the electromagnetic one, which describe electromagnetic force and the other forces operating at a nuclear scale, whose quanta are similar to the photons.The standard model was not taken very seriously at first, due to its somewhat cobbledtogether aspect, so different from the airy simplicity of general relativity and Maxwells or Diracs equations. Against expectations, however, all of its predictions have been confirmed. For more than thirty years, every single experiment of particle physics has done nothing but repeatedly reconfirm the standard model. A recent confirmation was the discovery of the Higgs particle, which caused a sensation in . Introduced to render the theory coherent, the Higgs field seemed a bit artificial until the Higgs particle, the quantum of this field, was actually observed and found to have precisely the properties predicted by the standard model.fn The fact that it has been called the God particle is so stupid as to be unworthy of comment. In short, despite its unjustly modest name, the standard model has been a triumph.Figure . What is the world made ofQuantum mechanics, with its fieldsparticles, offers today a spectacularly effective description of nature. The world is not made up of fields and particles but of a single type of entity: the quantum field. There are no longer particles which move in space with the passage of time, but quantum fields whose elementary events happen in spacetime. The world is strange, but simple figure ..Quanta : Information is finiteThe time has come to attempt some conclusions about what it is, precisely, that quantum mechanics tells us about the world. It isnt an easy task, because quantum mechanics is not conceptually clear and its true meaning remains controversial but its a necessary exercise, to gain clarity and go forward. I think that quantum mechanics has revealed three aspects of the nature of things: granularity, indeterminacy and the relational structure of the world. Lets look at each of these more closely.The first is the existence of a fundamental granularity in nature. The granularity of matter and light is at the heart of quantum theory. It isnt the same granularity intuited by Democritus, however. For Democritus, atoms were like little pebbles, whereas in quantum mechanics particles vanish and reappear. But the root of the idea of the substantive granularity of the world is still to be found in ancient atomism, and quantum mechanics strengthened by centuries of experiments, by powerful mathematics, and by its extraordinary capacity for making correct predictions is a genuine recognition of the profound insights on the nature of things reached by the great philosopher of Abdera.Say we make measurements on a physical system and find that the system is in a particular state. For instance, we measure the amplitude of the oscillations of a pendulum and find that it has a certain value say, somewhere between five centimetres and six centimetres no measurement is exact in physics. Before quantum mechanics we would have said that, since there are an infinite number of possible values between five and six centimetres for instance . or . or . , then there are infinite possible states of motion in which the pendulum could find itself: the amount of our ignorance about the pendulum state is still infinite.Instead, quantum mechanics tells us that between five and six centimetres there is a finite number of possible values of the amplitude, hence our missing information about the pendulum is finite.This goes for everything in general.fn Therefore, the first meaning of quantum mechanics is the existence of a limit to the information that can exist within a system: a limit to the number of distinguishable states in which a system can be. This limitation upon infinity this granularity of nature glimpsed by Democritus is the first central aspect of the theory. Plancks constant h measures the elementary scale of this granularity.Quanta : IndeterminacyThe world is a sequence of granular quantum events. These are discrete, granular and individual they are individual interactions of one physical system with another. An electron, a quantum of a field or a photon does not follow a trajectory in space but appears in a given place and at a given time when colliding with something else. When and where will it appear There is no way of knowing with certainty. Quantum mechanics introduces an elementary indeterminacy to the heart of the world. The future is genuinely unpredictable. This is the second fundamental lesson learned with quantum mechanics.Due to this indeterminacy, in the world described by quantum mechanics, things are constantly subject to random change. All the variables fluctuate continually, as if, at the smallest scale, everything is constantly vibrating. We do not see these omnipresent fluctuations only because of their small scale they cannot be observed at a large scale, as when we observe macroscopic bodies. If we look at a stone, it stays still. But if we could see its atoms, we would observe them constantly spread here and there, and in ceaseless vibration. Quantum mechanics reveals to us that, the more we look at the detail of the world, the less constant it is. The world is not made up of tiny pebbles. It is a world of vibrations, a continuous fluctuation, a microscopic swarming of fleeting microevents.The atomism of antiquity had anticipated also this aspect of modern physics: the appearance of laws of probability at a deep level. Democritus assumed just like Newton that the movement of atoms was rigorously determined by their collisions. But his successor, Epicurus, corrects the determinism of the master and introduces into atomism the notion of indeterminacy in the same way in which Heisenberg introduces indeterminacy into Newtons determinism. For Epicurus, atoms can on occasion deviate by chance from their course. Lucretius says this in beautiful words: this deviation occurs incerto tempore incertisque loci: at an uncertain place, at an uncertain time. The same randomness, the same appearance of probability at an elementary level, is the second key discovery about the world that quantum mechanics expresses.So, how do we compute the probability that an electron in a certain initial position A will reappear, after a given time, in one or another final position In the s, Richard Feynman, who Ive already mentioned, found a suggestive method of making this calculation: consider all possible trajectories from A to , that is to say, all possible trajectories the electron can follow straight, curved, zigzagging . Each trajectory determines a number. The probability is obtained from the sum of all these numbers. The details of this calculation are not important: what matters is the fact that all trajectories from A to B contribute: it is as if the electron, in order to go from A to , passed through all possible trajectories, or, in other words, unfurled into a cloud in order then to converge mysteriously on point , where it collides again with something else figure ..Figure . In order to move from A to B an electron behaves as if passing through all possible trajectories.This technique for computing the probability of a quantum event is called Feynmans sum over paths,fn and we shall see that it plays a role in quantum gravity.Quanta : Reality is relationalThe third discovery about the world articulated by quantum mechanics is the most profound and difficult and one which was not anticipated by the atomism of antiquity.The theory does not describe things as they are: it describes how things occur and how they interact with each other. It doesnt describe where there is a particle but how the particle shows itself to others. The world of existent things is reduced to a realm of possible interactions. Reality is reduced to interaction. Reality is reduced to relation.In a certain sense, this is just an extension of relativity, albeit a radical one. Aristotle was first to emphasize that we only perceive relative speed. On a ship, for example, we talk of our speed relative to the ship on land, relative to the Earth. Galileo understood that this is the reason why the Earth can move with respect to the Sun without us feeling the movement. Speed is not a property of an object on its own: it is the property of the motion of an object with respect to another object. Einstein extended the notion of relativity to time: we can say that two events are simultaneous only relatively to a given motion see here. Quantum mechanics extends this relativity in a radical way: all variable aspects of an object exist only in relation to other objects. It is only in interactions that nature draws the world.In the world described by quantum mechanics there is no reality except in the relations between physical systems. It isnt things that enter into relations but, rather, relations that ground the notion of thing. The world of quantum mechanics is not a world of objects: it is a world of events. Things are built by the happening of elementary events: as the philosopher Nelson Goodman wrote in the s, in a beautiful phrase, An object is a monotonous process. A stone is a vibration of quanta that maintains its structure for a while, just as a marine wave maintains its identity for a while before melting again into the sea.What is a wave, which moves on water without carrying with it any drop of water A wave is not an object, in the sense that it is not made of matter that travels with it. The atoms of our body, as well, flow in and away from us. We, like waves and like all objects, are a flux of events we are processes, for a brief time monotonous Quantum mechanics does not describe objects: it describes processes and events which are junction points between processes.To summarize, quantum mechanics is the discovery of three features of the world:Granularity figure .. The information in the state of a system is finite, and limited by Planks constant.Indeterminacy. The future is not determined unequivocally by the past. Even the more rigid regularities we see are, ultimately, statistical.Relationality. The events of nature are always interactions. All events of a system occur in relation to another system.Quantum mechanics teaches us not to think about the world in terms of things which are in this or that state but in terms of processes instead. A process is the passage from one interaction to another. The properties of things manifest themselves in a granular manner only in the moment of interaction, that is to say, at the edges of the processes, and are such only in relation to other things. They cannot be predicted in an unequivocal way but only in a probabilistic one.Figure . The light box in Einsteins mental experiment, as drawn by Bohr.This is the vertiginous dive taken by Bohr, Heisenberg and Dirac into the depth of the nature of things.But do we really understandCertainly, quantum mechanics is a triumph of efficacy. And yet are you sure, dear reader, that you have fully understood what quantum mechanics reveals to us An electron is nowhere when it is not interacting mmm things only exist by jumping from one interaction to another well Does it all seem a little absurdIt seemed absurd to Einstein.On the one hand, Einstein proposed Werner Heisenberg and Paul Dirac for the Nobel Prize, recognizing that they had understood something fundamental about the world. On the other, he took every opportunity to grumble that, however, none of this made much senseThe young lions of the Copenhagen group were dismayed: how could this come from Einstein himself Their spiritual father, the man who had the courage to think the unthinkable, now pulled back and feared this new leap into the unknown the very leap which he had himself triggered. How could it be that the same Einstein, who had taught us that time is not universal and that space bends, was now saying that the world could not be this strangeNiels Bohr patiently explained the new ideas to Einstein. Einstein objected. Bohr, in the end, always managed to find answers to the objections. The dialogue continued for years, by way of lectures, letters, articles Einstein devised mental experiments to show that the new ideas were contradictory: Imagine a box filled with light, from which is let escape for a brief instant a single photon : thus one of the most famous examples of these begins figure ..fnDuring the course of the exchange, both great men had to give way, to alter their ideas. Einstein was obliged to recognize that there was actually no contradiction within the new ideas. But Bohr had to recognize that things were not as simple and as clear as he thought. Einstein did not want to relent on what for him was the key point: the notion that there is an objective reality, independent of whatever interacted with what. He refused to accept the relational aspect of the theory, the fact that things manifest themselves only through interactions. Bohr did not want to concede on the validity of the profoundly new way in which the real was conceptualized by the theory. Ultimately, Einstein accepts that the theory represents a gigantic leap forward in our understanding of the world, and that it is coherent. But he remains convinced that things could not be as strange as this theory proposed and that, behind it, there must be a further, more reasonable explanation.A century has passed, and we are at the same point. Richard Feynman, who more than anyone has known how to juggle with the theory, has written, I think I can state that nobody really understands quantum mechanics.The equations of the theory and their consequences are used daily in a wide variety of fields: by physicists, engineers, chemists and biologists. But they remain mysterious: they do not describe physical systems but only how physical systems interact with and affect one another. What does this meanPhysicists and philosophers continue to ask themselves what the real meaning of the theory might be and, in recent years, articles and conferences on the issue have proliferated. What is quantum theory, a century after its birth An extraordinary dive deep into the nature of reality A blunder that works, by chance Part of an incomplete puzzle Or a clue to something profound regarding the structure of the world, which we have yet to fully decipherThe interpretation of quantum mechanics which I have presented here is the one which seems least unreasonable to me. It is called the relational interpretation, and it has been discussed by serious philosophers such as Bas van Fraassen, Michel Bitbol and Mauro Dorato. But there is no consensus on how to think about quantum mechanics: there are other ways of thinking about it, discussed by other physicists and other philosophers. We are on the brink of that which we dont know, and opinions diverge.Quantum mechanics is only a physics theory: perhaps tomorrow it will be corrected by an understanding of the world which is different and even more profound. Some scientists today try to iron it out a bit, to render it more in keeping with our intuition. In my opinion, its dramatic empirical success should compel us to take it seriously, and to ask ourselves not what there is to change in the theory but rather what is limited about our intuition that makes it seem so strange to us.I think that the obscurity of the theory is not the fault of quantum mechanics but, rather, is due to the limited capacity of our imagination. When we try to see the quantum world, we are rather like moles used to living underground to whom someone is trying to describe the Himalayas. Or like the men imprisoned at the back of Platos cave.When Einstein died, his greatest rival, Bohr, found for him words of moving admiration. When, a few years later, Bohr in turn died, someone took a photograph of the blackboard in his study. Theres a drawing on it. It represents the box of light of Einsteins thought experiment. To the very last, the desire to debate, to understand more. To the very last, doubt.This permanent doubt, the deep source of science.Part Three M E D L If you have followed me this far, you now have all the elements with which to understand the current image of the world suggested by fundamental physics its power, its weaknesses, its limits.There is a curved spacetime born billion years ago nobody knows how and still expanding. This space is a real object, a physical field with its dynamics described by Einsteins equations. Space bends and curves under the weight of matter and plunges into black holes when matter is too concentrated.Matter is distributed in billion galaxies, each containing billion stars, and is made up of quantum fields which manifest themselves in the form of particles, such as electrons and photons, or as waves, such as the electromagnetic ones that bring us television images and the light of the Sun and the stars.These quantum fields make up atoms, light and the full contents of the universe. They are strange objects: their quanta are particles that appear when they interact with something else left alone, they unfurl into a cloud of probability. The world is a swarming of elementary events, immersed in the sea of a vast dynamical space which sways like the water of an ocean.With this image of the world, and the few equations that make it concrete, we can describe almost everything that we see.Almost. Something is missing. And it is this something that we are seeking. The rest of the book talks about this missing part.Turning the page, you pass from what, for good or ill, we credibly know about the world, to what we dont yet know but are trying to glimpse.Turning the page is like leaving the security of our small spacecraft of nearcertainties and stepping into the unknown.. Spacetime is QuantumThere is a paradox at the heart of our understanding of the physical world. General relativity and quantum mechanics, the two jewels that the twentieth century has left us, have been prolific in gifts for comprehending the world and for todays technology. From the first of these, cosmology has developed, as well as astrophysics, the study of gravitational waves and of black holes. The second has provided the foundation for atomic physics, nuclear physics, the physics of elementary particles and of condensed matter, and of much else besides.And yet between the two theories there is something that grates. They cannot both be true, at least not in their present forms, because they appear to contradict each other. The gravitational field is described without taking quantum mechanics into account, without accounting for the fact that fields are quantum fields and quantum mechanics is formulated without taking into account the fact that spacetime curves and is described by Einsteins equations.A university student attending lectures on general relativity in the morning, and others on quantum mechanics in the afternoon, might be forgiven for concluding that his professors are fools, or that they havent talked to each other for at least a century. In the morning, the world is a curved spacetime where everything is continuous in the afternoon, the world is a flat one where discrete quanta of energy leap and interact.The paradox resides in the fact that both theories work remarkably well.With every experiment and every test, nature continues to say you are right to general relativity, and continues to say you are right to quantum mechanics as well, despite the seemingly opposite assumptions on which the two theories are founded. It is clear that something still eludes us.In most situations we can neglect quantum mechanics or general relativity or both. The Moon is too large to be sensitive to minute quantum granularity, so we can forget the quanta when describing its movements. On the other hand, an atom is too light to curve space to a significant degree, and when we describe it we can forget the curvature of space. But there are situations where both curvature of space and quantum granularity matter, and for these we do not yet have an established physical theory that works.An example is the interior of black holes. Another is what happened to the universe during the Big Bang. In more general terms, we do not know how time and space behave at very small scale. In all these instances, todays theories become confused and no longer tell us anything reasonable: quantum mechanics cannot deal with the curvature of spacetime, and general relativity cannot account for quanta. This is the problem of quantum gravity.The problem goes even deeper. Einstein understood that space and time are manifestations of a physical field: the gravitational field. Bohr, Heisenberg and Dirac understood that physical fields have a quantum character: granular, probabilistic, manifesting through interactions. It follows that space and time must also be quantum entities possessing these strange properties.What, then, is quantum space What is quantum time This is the problem we call quantum gravity. A band of theoretical physicists scattered across five continents is laboriously seeking to solve the problem. Their objective is to find a theory, that is to say, a set of equations but, above all, a coherent vision of the world with which to resolve the current schizophrenia between quanta and gravity.It isnt the first time that physics has found itself faced with two highly successful but apparently contradictory theories. The effort to synthesize has in the past been rewarded with great strides forward in our understanding of the world. Newton discovered universal gravity precisely by combining Galileos physics of how things move on Earth with Keplers physics of the heavens. Maxwell and Faraday found the equations of electromagnetism by bringing together what was known about electricity and what was known about magnetism. Einstein found special relativity in order to resolve the apparent conflict between Newtons mechanics and Maxwells electromagnetism and then general relativity in order to resolve the resulting conflict between Newtons mechanics and his own special relativity.Theoretical physicists are thus only too happy when they discover a conflict of this type: it is an extraordinary opportunity. The question to ask is: can we construct a conceptual structure compatible with what we have learned about the world with both theoriesTo comprehend what quantum space and quantum time are, we need once more to revise in depth the way we conceive things. We need to rethink the grammar of our understanding of the world. Just as happened with Anaximander, who understood that Earth flies in space, and that up and down do not exist in the cosmos or with Copernicus, who understood that we are moving across the heavens at great speed or with Einstein, who understood that spacetime squashes like a mollusc, and time passes differently in different places once again, in seeking a coherent vision of the world in keeping with what we have learned about it, our ideas about the nature of reality have to change.Figure . Matvei Brontejn.The first to realize that our conceptual basis must change in order to understand quantum gravity was a romantic and legendary character: Matvei Brontejn, a young Russian who lived during the Stalin era and died tragically.MatveiMatvei was a younger friend of Lev Landau the scientist who would go on to become the best theoretical physicist of the Soviet Union. Colleagues who knew them both would claim that, of the two, Matvei was the more brilliant. At the point when Heisenberg and Dirac were constructing the bases of quantum mechanics, Landau, wrongly, thought that fields became ill defined due to quanta: quantum fluctuation would prevent us from measuring the value of a component of a field at a point an arbitrary small region in space. The masterly Bohr immediately saw that Landau was wrong, studied the issue in depth and wrote a long and detailed article to show that fields, such as the electric one, remain well defined even when quantum mechanics is brought to bear. Landau dropped the issue.But his young friend Matvei was intrigued, realizing that Landaus intuition, though imprecise, contained something of importance. He repeated the same reasoning by which Bohr had demonstrated that the quantum electric field was well defined at a point of space, applying it instead to the gravitational field, for which Einstein had just a few years previously written the equations. And here surprise! Landau was right. The gravitational field at a point is not well defined, when taking quanta into account.There is an intuitive way of understanding what happens. Suppose we want to observe a very, very, very small region of space. To do this, we need to place something in this area, to mark the point that we wish to consider. Say we place a particle there. Heisenberg had understood that you cant locate a particle at a point in space for long. It soon escapes. The smaller the region in which we try to locate a particle, the greater the velocity at which it escapes. This is Heisenbergs uncertainty principle. If the particle escapes at great speed, it has a great deal of energy. Now let us take Einsteins theory into account. Energy makes space curve. A lot of energy means that space will curve a great deal. A lot of energy in a small region results in curving space so much that it collapses into a black hole, like a collapsing star. But if a particle plummets into a black hole, I can no longer see it. I can no longer use it as a reference point for a region of space. I cant manage to measure arbitrarily small regions of space, because if I try to do this these regions disappear inside a black hole.This argument can be made more precise with a little mathematics. The result is general: quantum mechanics and general relativity, taken together, imply that there is a limit to the divisibility of space. Below a certain scale, nothing more is accessible. More precisely, nothing exists there.How small is this minimal region of space The calculation is easy: we need only to calculate the minimum size of a particle before it falls into its own black hole, and the result is straightforward. The minimum length is around:Under the sign of the square root there are the three constants of nature we have already encountered: Newtons constant , discussed in Chapter , which sets the strength of gravity the speed of light c, introduced in Chapter when discussing relativity, which opens up the extended present and Plancks constant h, found in Chapter , which determines the scale of the quantum granularity.fn The presence of these three constants confirms the fact that we are looking at something which has to do with gravity , relativity c and quantum mechanics h.The length , determined in this fashion, is called the Planck length. It should be called the Brontejn length, but such is the way of the world. In numerical terms, it is equivalent to approximately one millionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a centimetre centimetres. So, that is to say small.It is at this extremely minute scale that quantum gravity manifests itself. To give an idea of the smallness of the scale we are discussing: if we enlarged a walnut shell until it had become as big as the whole observable universe, we would still not see the Planck length. Even after having been enormously magnified thus, it would still be a million times smaller than the actual walnut shell was before magnification. At this scale, space and time change their nature. They become something different they become quantum space and time, and understanding what this means is the problem.Matvei Brontejn understands all of this in the s and writes two short and illuminating articles in which he points out that quantum mechanics and general relativity, taken together, are incompatible with our customary idea of space as an infinitely divisible continuum.There is, however, a problem. Matvei and Lev are sincere communists. They believe in revolution as the liberation of mankind, the construction of a genuinely better society, without injustice, without the immense inequalities which we still see growing systematically throughout the world. They are enthusiastic followers of Lenin. When Stalin assumes power, they are both perplexed, then critical, then hostile. They write articles which are mildly but openly critical This was not the communism they wanted But these are harsh times. Landau gets through them, not easily, but he survives. Matvei, the year after having been the first to understand that our ideas on space and time had to change in a radical way, is arrested by Stalins police and condemned to death. His execution takes place on the same day as his trial, February, . He is thirty years old.JohnAfter Matvei Brontejns premature death, many of the centurys eminent physicists tried to solve the puzzle of quantum gravity. Dirac dedicated the final years of his life to the problem, opening avenues and introducing ideas and techniques on which a good part of current work on quantum gravity is based. It is thanks to these techniques that we know how to describe a world without time, as I will explain further on. Feynman tried, attempting to adapt the techniques he had developed for electrons and photons to the context of general relativity, but without success: electrons and photons are quanta in space quantum gravity is something else: it isnt enough to describe gravitons moving in space, it is space itself that has to be quantized.A few Nobel Prizes were awarded to physicists who happened to resolve other problems, almost by mistake, during the course of their attempts to disentangle the puzzle of quantum gravity. Two Dutch physicists, Gerardt Hooft and Martinus Veltman, received the Nobel Prize in for having shown the consistency of the theories which today are used to describe nuclear forces a part of the standard model but their research programme was actually aiming to demonstrate the consistency of a theory of quantum gravity. They were working on the theories of these other forces only as a preliminary exercise. The preliminary exercise earned them a Nobel Prize, but they did not succeed in showing the consistency of their version of quantum gravity.The list could go on and would read like a roll of honour of the centurys outstanding theoretical physicists. As well as like a catalogue of failures. Very gradually, though, over the course of decades, ideas were clarified and dead ends explored and usefully closed off techniques and general ideas were strengthened, and results began to build, one developing from another. To mention here the numerous scientists who have contributed to this gradual, slowmoving, collective construction would require a tedious list of names, each one of whom has added a grain or a stone to the process.I would like to mention just one, who for years held together the threads of this collective research: the remarkable, eternally youthful Englishman half philosopher and half physicist Chris Isham. It was when reading one of his articles reviewing the question of quantum gravity that I first became enamoured with the problem. The article explained just why it was so difficult, how our conception of space and time needed to be modified, and gave a lucid overview of all the routes which were being followed at the time, with the results achieved, and difficulties entailed. I was in my third year at university, and the possibility of rethinking space and time from square one fascinated me. This fascination has never diminished. For, as Petrarch sings, The wound does not heal due to the weakening of the bow.Figure . John Wheeler.The scientist who has most contributed to quantum gravity is John Wheeler, a legendary figure who has traversed the physics of the past century. A pupil of and collaborator with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen a collaborator with Einstein when Einstein moved to the United States a teacher who can count among his students figures such as Richard Feynman Wheeler was at the heart of the physics of the twentieth century. He was gifted with a fervid imagination. It was he who invented and made popular the term black hole. His name is associated with the early extended investigations frequently more intuitive than mathematical into how to think about quantum spacetime. Having absorbed Brontejns lesson that quantum properties of the gravitational field imply a modification of the notion of space at a small scale, Wheeler looked for novel ideas to help conceive of this quantum space. He imagined it as a cloud of superimposed geometries, just as we can think of a quantum electron as a cloud of positions.Imagine that you are looking at the sea from a great height: you perceive a vast expanse of it, a flat, cerulean table. Now you descend and look at it more closely. You begin to make out the great waves swollen by the wind. You descend further, and you see that the waves break up and that the surface of the sea is a turbulent frothing. This is what space is like, as imagined by Wheeler.fn On our scale, immensely larger than the Planck length, space is smooth. If we move down to the Planck scale, it shatters and foams.Wheeler sought a way to describe this foaming of space, this wave of probability of different geometries. In , a young colleague of his who lived in Carolina, Bryce DeWitt, provided the key. Wheeler travelled frequently, and met collaborators wherever he could. He asks Bryce to meet at Raleigh Durham airport, in North Carolina, where he had a few hours wait between connecting flights. Bryce arrives and shows him an equation for a wave function of space, obtained by using a simple mathematical trick.fn Wheeler is enthused. From this conversation a type of equation of orbitals for general relativity is born an equation which should determine the probability of one or another curved spaces. For a long time, DeWitt called it Wheelers equationfn while Wheeler called it the DeWitt equation. Everyone else calls it the WheelerDeWitt equation.The idea is very good, and becomes a basis for the attempts to construct the full theory of quantum gravity. But the equation itself is riddled with problems serious ones. In the first place, from a mathematical point of view, the equation is really quite badly defined. If we try to use it to do calculations, we soon obtain results that are infinite, which makes no sense. It must be improved.But it is also difficult to understand how to interpret this equation, to know what it means. Among its disconcerting aspects is the fact that it no longer contains the time variable. How can it be used to compute the evolution of something which happens in time if it does not include a time variable Dynamical equations, in physics, always contain the variable t, time. What does a physical theory without a temporal variable signify For years, research will revolve around such questions, trying to revise the equation in different manners, in order to improve its definition and understand what it might mean.The first steps of the loopsThe fog begins to dissipate towards the end of the s. Surprisingly, some solutions of the WheelerDeWitt equation appear. During these years I found myself first at the University of Syracuse, in New York State, visiting the Indian physicist Abhay Ashtekar, and then in Connecticut, at Yale University, visiting the American physicist Lee Smolin. I remember a period of intense discussions and burning intellectual fervour. Ashtekar had rewritten the WheelerDe Witt equation in a simpler form and Smolin, together with Ted Jacobson of the University of Maryland in Washington, had been the first to find some of these new strange solutions of the equation.The solutions had a curious peculiarity: they depended on closed lines in space. A closed line is a loop. Smolin and Jacobson could write a solution to the WheelerDeWitt equation for every loop: for every line closed on itself. What did this mean The first works of what will later become known as loop quantum gravity emerge from these discussions, as the meaning of these solutions of the WheelerDeWitt equation gradually clarify. Upon these solutions, little by little, a coherent theory begins to be erected, inheriting the name loop theory from the first solutions studied.Today there are hundreds of scientists working on this theory, spread throughout the world from China to Argentina, from Indonesia to the United States. What is slowly being erected is the theory now known as loop theory, or loop quantum gravity: the theory to which the following chapters are devoted. It is not the only direction explored in the search for a quantum theory of gravity, but it is the one I consider the most promising.fn. Quanta of SpaceThe last chapter closed with the solutions of the Wheeler DeWitt equation discovered by Jacobson and Smolin. These solutions depend on lines that close on themselves, or loop. What does it all meanRemember Faradays lines the lines which carry the electric force and which, in Faradays vision, fill space The lines from which the concept of field originates Well, the closed lines that appear in the solutions of the WheelerDeWitt equation are Faraday lines of the gravitational field.But two new ingredients are now added to Faradays ideas.The first is that we are dealing with quantum theory. In quantum theory, everything is discrete. This implies that the infinitely fine, continuous spiderweb of Faradays lines now becomes similar to a real spiderweb: it has a finite number of distinct threads. Every single line determining a solution of the WheelerDeWitt equation describes one of the threads of this web.The second new aspect, the crucial one, is that we are speaking of gravity and, therefore, as Einstein understood, we are not speaking of fields immersed in space but of the very structure of space itself. Faradays lines of the quantum gravitational field are the threads of which space is woven.At first, the research was focused on these lines and how they could weave our threedimensional physical space. Figure . represents an early attempt to give an intuitive idea of the discrete structure of space which would result from this.Soon after, thanks to the intuitions and mathematical ability of young scientists such as the Argentine Jorge Pullin and the Pole Jurek Lewandowski, it became clear that the key to understanding the physics of these solutions lies in the points where these lines intersect. These points are called nodes, and the lines between nodes are called links. A set of intersecting lines forms what is called a graph, that is to say, a combination of nodes connected by links, as in figure ..A calculation, in fact, demonstrates that, without nodes, physical space has no volume. In other words, it is in the nodes of the graph, not in the lines, that the volume of space resides. The lines link together individual volumes sitting at the nodes.Getting to a full clarification of the resulting picture of quantum spacetime took years. It was necessary to transform the illdefined mathematics of the WheelerDe Witt equation into a structure sufficiently well defined to be able to compute with. With this, it became possible to achieve precise results. The key technical result which clarifies the physical meaning of the graphs is the calculation of the spectra of volume and of area.Figure . The quantum version of Faradays lines of force, which weave space like a threedimensional mesh of interlinked rings loops.Figure . The spectrum of the volume: the volumes of a regular tetrahedron that are possible in nature are limited in number. The smallest, at the bottom, is the smallest volume in existence.Spectra of volume and areaTake any region of space, for example, the room in which you are reading this, if you are in a room. How big is this room The size of the space of the room is measured by its volume. Volume is a geometrical quantity which depends on the geometry of space, but the geometry of space as Einstein understood, and as I recounted in Chapter is the gravitational field. Volume is therefore a property of the gravitational field, expressing how much gravitational field there is between the walls of the room. But the gravitational field is a physical quantity and, like all physical quantities, is subject to the laws of quantum mechanics. In particular, like all physical quantities, volume may not assume arbitrary values but only certain particular ones, as I described in Chapter . The list of all possible values is called, if you remember, the spectrum. Hence there should exist a spectrum of the volume figure .Dirac provided us with the formula with which to compute the spectrum of every variable. The calculation took time, first to formulate it and then to complete it, and made us suffer. It was completed in the mids, and the answer, as expected Feynman used to say that we should never do a calculation without first knowing the result, is that the spectrum of the volume is discrete. That is, the volume can only be made up of discrete packets. These are somewhat similar to the energy of the electromagnetic field, which is also formed of discrete packets: photons.The nodes of the graph represent the discrete packets of volume and, as in the case of photons, can only have certain sizes, which can be computed using Diracs general quantum equation.fn Every node n in the graph has its own volume vn: one of the numbers in the spectrum of the volume. The nodes are the elementary quanta of which physical space is made. Every node of the graph is a quantum particle of space. The structure that emerges is the one illustrated in figure ..Figure . On the left, a graph formed by nodes connected by links. On the right, the grains of space which the graph represents. The links indicate the adjacent particles, separated by surfaces.A link is an individual quantum of a Faraday line. Now we can understand what it represents: if you imagine two nodes as two small regions of space, these two regions will be separated by a small surface. The size of this surface is its area. The second quantity, after the volume, which characterizes the quantum webs of space, is the area associated with each line.fnThe area, just as in the case of the volume, is a physical variable, and has a spectrum which may be calculated using Diracs equation. Area is not continuous, it is granular. There is no such thing as an arbitrarily small area.Space appears continuous to us only because we cannot perceive the extremely small scale of these individual quanta of space. Just as when we look closely at the cloth of a Tshirt, we see that it is woven from small threads.When we say that the volume of a room is, for example, cubic metres, we are in effect counting the grains of space the quanta of the gravitational field which it contains. In a room, this number has more than a hundred digits. When we say that the area of this page is square centimetres, we are actually counting the number of links in the web, or loops, which traverse the page. Across the page of this book, there is a number of quanta with more or less seventy digits.The idea that measuring length, area and volume is a question of counting individual elements had been proposed in the nineteenth century by Riemann himself. The mathematician who had developed the theory of continuous curved mathematical spaces was already aware that a discrete physical space is, ultimately, more reasonable than a continuous one.To summarize, the theory of loop quantum gravity, or loop theory, combines general relativity with quantum mechanics in a rather conservative way, because it does not employ any other hypothesis apart from those of the two theories themselves, suitably rewritten to render them compatible. But the consequences are radical.General relativity taught us that space is something dynamic, like the electromagnetic field: an immense, mobile mollusc in which we are immersed, which stretches and bends. Quantum mechanics teaches us that every field of this sort is made of quanta, that is to say, it has a fine, granular structure. It follows that physical space, being a field, is made of quanta as well. The same granular structure characterizing the other quantum fields also characterizes the quantum gravitational field, and therefore space. We expect space to be granular. We expect quanta of gravity, just as there are quanta of light, quanta of the electromagnetic field, and as particles are quanta of quantum fields. But space is the gravitational field, and the quanta of the gravitational field are quanta of space: the granular constituents of space.The central prediction of loop theory is therefore that space is not a continuum, it is not divisible ad infinitum, it is formed of atoms of space. A billion billion times smaller than the smallest of atomic nuclei.Loop theory describes this atomic and granular quantum structure of space in a precise mathematical form. It is obtained by applying the general equations of quantum mechanics written by Dirac to Einsteins gravitational field.In particular, loop theory specifies that volume for example, the volume of a given cube cannot be arbitrarily small. A minimum volume exists. No space smaller than this minimum volume exists. There is a minimum quantum of volume: an elementary atom of space.Atoms of spaceRemember Achilles chasing after the tortoise Zeno observed that there is something difficult to accept in the idea that Achilles has to cover an infinite number of distances before reaching the slowmoving creature. Mathematics had found a possible answer to this difficulty, showing how an infinite number of progressively smaller intervals could nevertheless amount to a finite total interval.But is this what truly happens in nature Are there intervals between Achilles and the tortoise that can be arbitrarily short Does it really make sense to talk of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a millimetre, and then to think of dividing it again further innumerable timesThe calculation of the quantum spectra of geometric quantities indicates that the answer is negative: arbitrarily small chunks of space do not exist. There is a lower limit to the divisibility of space. It is at a very small scale indeed, but it is there. This is what Matvei Brontejn had intuited in the s. The calculation of the spectra of volume and area confirms Brontejns idea and frames it in a mathematically precise manner.Achilles does not need an infinite number of steps to reach the tortoise because, in a space made of grains of finite size, infinitely small steps do not exist. The hero will come ever closer to the creature until, in the end, he reaches it in a single quantum leap.But, on reflection, was this not precisely the solution proposed by Leucippus and by Democritus They spoke of the granular structure of matter, and we are rather unsure as to what, precisely, they said about space. Unfortunately, we do not have their texts and must make do with the sparse fragments in the citations of others. It is like trying to reconstruct Shakespeares plays from a list of Shakespeare quotes.fn Democrituss argument on the incongruity of the continuum as a collection of points, reported by Aristotle, may be applied to space. I imagine that if we could ask Democritus if it makes sense to split a space interval ad infinitum, his reply could only be to repeat that divisibility must have a limit. For the philosopher of Abdera, matter is made of atoms that cannot be divided. Having once understood that space is very much like matter space, as he had said himself, has its own nature, a certain physics I suspect he would not have hesitated to deduce that space, too, can only be made of elementary chunks that cannot be divided. We are perhaps just following in the footsteps of Democritus.I certainly dont mean to imply that the physics of two millennia was useless, that experiments and mathematics are pointless and that Democritus could be as convincing as modern science. Obviously not. Without experiments and mathematics, we would never have understood what we have understood. Yet we develop our conceptual schema for understanding the world by exploring new ideas but also by building on the powerful intuitions of giant figures from the past. Democritus is one of them, and we discover the new sitting on his titanic shoulders.But let us return to quantum gravity.Spin networksThe graphs which describe the quantum states of space are characterized by a volume v for every node and a halfinteger j for every line. A graph with this additional information is called a spin network figure .. Halfintegers in physics are called spin because they appear in the quantum mechanics of spinning objects. A spin network represents a quantum state of the gravitational field: a quantum state of space a granular space in which area and volume are discrete. Finemesh grids are used elsewhere in physics to approximate continuous space. Here, there is no space continuum to approximate: space is genuinely granular.The crucial difference between photons the quanta of the electromagnetic field and the nodes of the graph the quanta of gravity is that photons exist in space, whereas the quanta of gravity constitute space themselves. Photons are characterized by where they are.fn Quanta of space have no place to be in, because they are themselves that place. They have only one piece of information which characterizes them spatially: information about which other quanta of space they are adjacent to, which one is next to which other. This information is expressed by the links in the graph. Two nodes connected by a link are two nodes in proximity. They are two grains of space in contact with each other: this touching constructs the structure of space.Figure . A spin networkThe quanta of gravity, that is, are not in space, they are themselves space. The spin networks which describe the quantum structure of the gravitational field are not immersed in space they do not inhabit a space. The location of single quanta of space is not defined with regard to something else but only by the links and the relation these express.If I step from grain to grain along the links until I complete a circuit and return to the grain from which I started, I will have made a loop. These are the original loops of the loop theory. In Chapter I showed that the curvature of space may be measured by looking at whether an arrow transported across a closed circuit returns pointing in the same direction, or turned. The mathematics of the theory determines this curvature for every closed circuit on a spin network, and this makes it possible to evaluate the curvature of spacetime, and hence the force of the gravitational field, from the structure of a spin network.fnNow, quantum mechanics is more than granularity. There is also the fact that evolution is probabilistic the way in which the spin networks evolve is random. Ill speak about this in the next chapter, devoted to time.And there is the fact that what matters is not how things are, but rather how they interact. Spin networks are not entities they describe the effect of space upon things. Just as an electron is in no place but diffused in a cloud of probability in all places, space is not actually formed by a single specific spin network but rather by a cloud of probabilities over the whole range of all possible spin networks.At an extremely small scale, space is a fluctuating swarm of quanta of gravity which act upon each other, and together act upon things, manifesting themselves in these interactions as spin networks, grains interrelated with each other figure ..Figure . At a minute scale, space is not continuous: it is woven from interconnected finite elements.Physical space is the fabric resulting from the ceaseless swarming of this web of relations. The lines themselves are nowhere they are not in a place but rather create places through their interactions. Space is created by the interaction of individual quanta of gravity.This is the first step towards understanding quantum gravity. The second concerns time. And, to time, the next chapter is devoted. The result of the calculation is simple. I show it here so you can see how Diracs spectra work. The possible values of the area A are given in the following formula, where j is a halfinteger, that is to say, a number which is half of an integer, such as , , , , , , A is the area that a surface separating two grains of space can have. is the number eight, nothing special about it. is the Greek pi which we studied at school: the constant which gives the relation between the circumference and the diameter of any circle, and which appears everywhere in physics, I dont know why. Lp is the Planck length, the extremely small scale at which the phenomena of quantum gravity take place. Lp is the square of Lp, which is the extremely small area of a tiny square with sides equal to the Planck length. Therefore Lp is simply a small area: the area of a minuscule square with a side which is about a millionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a centimetre cm. The interesting aspect of the formula is the square root and what is within it. The key point is that j is a halfinteger, that is to say, it may have only values which are multiples of . For each one of these, the root has a certain value, listed approximately in table ..Table . Spin halfintegers and corresponding value of the area in units of minimal area.Multiplying the numbers in the righthand column by the area Lp, we obtain the possible values of the area of the surface. These special values are like the ones which appear in the study of the orbits of electrons in atoms, where quantum mechanics allows only certain orbits. The point is that no other areas apart from the values derived by this equation exist. No surface can have an area one tenth of Lp.. Time Does Not ExistIt must not be claimed that anyone can sense time by itself apart from the movement of things. Lucretius, De rerum naturaThe alert reader will have realized that in the preceding chapter little attention was given to time. And yet Einstein showed, over a century ago, that we cannot separate time and space, that we must think of them together as a single whole: spacetime. The moment has come to rectify this and bring time back into the picture.Research on quantum gravity has revolved for years around spatial equations, before having the courage to confront time. In the last fifteen years, a way of thinking about time has begun to emerge. Ill try to explain it.Space as an amorphous container of things disappears from physics with quantum gravity. Things the quanta do not inhabit space, they dwell one over the other, and space is the fabric of their neighbouring relations. As we abandon the idea of space as an inert container, similarly, we must abandon the idea of time as an inert flow along which reality unfurls. Just as the idea of the space continuum containing things disappears, so, too, does the idea of a flowing continuum time during the course of which phenomena happen.In a certain sense, space no longer exists in fundamental theory the quanta of the gravitational field are not in space. In the same sense, time no longer exists in the fundamental theory: the quanta of gravity do not evolve in time. Time just counts their interactions. As evidenced with the WheelerDe Witt equation, the fundamental equations no longer contain the time variable. Time emerges, like space, from the quantum gravitational field.This was already partially true for classical general relativity, where time already appears as an aspect of the gravitational field. But as long as we neglect quantum theory, we can still think of spacetime in a rather conventional manner, like the tapestry in which the story of the rest of reality unfolds, even if it is a dynamical, moving tapestry. The moment we take quantum mechanics into account, we recognize that time, too, must have those aspects of probabilistic indeterminacy, granularity and relationality which are common to all of reality. It becomes a time markedly different from all that we have hitherto meant by the word.This second conceptual consequence of the theory of quantum gravity is more extreme even than the vanishing of space.Lets attempt to understand it.Time is not what we think it isThat the nature of time is different from the common idea which we have of it was already clear over a century ago. Special and general relativity made this explicit. Today, the inadequacy of our commonsense view of time can be easily verified in a laboratory.Lets reconsider, for example, the first consequence of general relativity, as illustrated in Chapter . Take two watches, ensure that they mark exactly the same time, place one on the floor and the other on a piece of furniture. Wait for about half an hour and then bring them back next to each other. Will they still tell the same timeAs described in Chapter , the answer is no. The watches which we usually wear on our wrists, or have on our mobile phones, are not sufficiently precise to allow us to verify this fact, but in physics laboratories all over the world there are timepieces precise enough to demonstrate the discrepancy which occurs: the watch left on the floor is slow when compared to the one which has been raised above it.Why Because time does not pass in the same way everywhere in the world. In some places, it flows more quickly in others, more slowly. The closer you get to the Earth, where gravityfn is more intense, the slower time passes. Remember the twins in Chapter , who ended up with different ages as a result of having lived one at sea level and one in the mountains The effect is very slight: the time gained during a life spent by the sea, with respect to one passed in the mountains, consists of fractions of a second but the smallness of the amount does not alter the fact that there is a real difference. Time does not work as we customarily imagine it does.We must not think of time as if there were a great cosmic clock that marks the life of the universe. We have known for more than a century that we must think of time instead as a localized phenomenon: every object in the universe has its own time running, at a pace determined by the local gravitational field.But even this notion of a localized time no longer works when we take the quantum nature of the gravitational field into account. Quantum events are no longer ordered by the passage of time at the Planck scale. Time, in a sense, ceases to exist.What does it mean to say that time does not existFirst, the absence of the variable time from the fundamental equations does not imply that everything is immobile and that change does not happen. On the contrary, it means that change is ubiquitous. Only: elementary processes cannot be ordered along a common succession of instants. At the extremely small scale of the quanta of space, the dance of nature does not develop to the rhythm kept by the baton of a single orchestral conductor: every process dances independently with its neighbours, following its own rhythm. The passing of time is intrinsic to the world, it is born of the world itself, out of the relations between quantum events which are the world and which themselves generate their own time.In fact, the nonexistence of time does not mean anything particularly complicated. Lets try to understand.The candle chandelier and the pulseTime appears in most equations of classic physics. It is the variable indicated by the letter t. The equations tell us how things change in time. If we know what has happened in the past, they allow us to predict the future. More precisely, we measure some variables for example, the position A of an object, the angle B of a swinging pendulum, the temperature C of an object and the equations of physics tell us how these variables , B and C will change with time. They predict the functions At, Bt, Ct, and so on, which describe the changing of these variables in time t.Galileo was the first to understand that the movement of objects on Earth could be described by equations for the functions of time At, Bt, Ct and the first to write explicit equations for these functions. The first law of terrestrial physics found by Galileo, for example, describes how an object falls, that is to say, how its altitude x varies with the passage of time t.fnTo discover and verify this law, Galileo needed two kinds of measurements. He had to measure the height x of the object and the time t. Therefore, he needed, in particular, an instrument to measure time. He needed a clock.When Galileo lived there were no accurate clocks. Galileo himself, as a young man, discovered a key to making precise timepieces. He discovered that the oscillations of a pendulum all have the same duration irrespective of the amplitude. Thus, it is possible to measure time by simply counting the oscillations of a pendulum. It seems such an obvious idea, but it took Galileo to find it it had not occurred to anyone before him. So it goes, with science.But things are not really this straightforward.According to legend, Galileo alighted on the idea in Pisas marvellous cathedral while watching the slow oscillations of a gigantic candle chandelier, which is still there. The legend is false, since the chandelier was actually first hung there years after Galileos death, but it makes for a good story. Perhaps there was another one hanging there at the time. The scientist was observing the oscillations during a religious service in which he was evidently not particularly absorbed, and he was measuring the duration of each oscillation of the chandelier by counting the beats of his own pulse. With mounting excitement, he discovered that the number of beats was the same for each oscillation: it did not change when the chandelier slowed and oscillated with diminished amplitude. The oscillations all had the same duration.Its a fine story but, on reflection, it leaves us perplexed and this perplexity goes to the heart of the problem of time. How could Galileo know that his own individual pulsebeats all lasted for the same amount of timefnNot many years after Galileo, doctors began to measure their patients pulses by using a watch which is nothing, after all, but a pendulum. So we use the beats to assure ourselves that the pendulum is regular, and then the pendulum to ascertain the regularity of the pulsebeats. Is this not somewhat circular What does it meanIt means that we, in reality, never measure time itself we always measure the physical variables , , C oscillations, beats, and many other things and compare one variable with another, that is to say, we measure the functions , , , and so on. We can count how many beats for each oscillation how many oscillations for every tick of my stopwatch how many ticks of my stopwatch between intervals of the clock on the belltower The point is that it is useful to imagine that a variable t exists the true time which underpins all those movements, even if we cannot measure it directly. We write the equations for the physical variables with regard to this unobservable t, equations which tell us how things change in t that is, for instance, how much time it takes for each oscillation, and how long each heartbeat lasts. From this, we can derive how the variables change in relation to each other how many heartbeats there are in one oscillation and compare this prediction with what we observe in the world. If the predictions are correct, we trust that this complicated schema is a sound one and, in particular, that it is useful to employ the variable of time t, even if we cannot measure it directly.In other words, the existence of the variable time is a useful assumption, not the result of an observation.It was Newton who understood all of this: he understood that this was a good way to proceed, and clarified and developed this schema. Newton asserts explicitly in his book that we cant ever measure the true time t but, if we assume that it exists, we can set up an efficient framework to describe nature.Having clarified this, we can return to quantum gravity and the meaning of the statement that time does not exist. It simply means that the Newtonian schema no longer works when we are dealing with small things. It was a good one, but only for large things.If we want to understand the world widely, if we want to understand how it functions in the less familiar situations where quantum gravity matters, we need to abandon this schema. The idea of a time t which flows by itself, and in relation to which all things evolve, is no longer a useful one. The world is not described by equations of evolution in time t. What we must do is simply to enumerate the variables , , C which we actually observe, and write equations expressing relations between these variables, and nothing else: that is, equations for the relations , , A which we observe, and not for the functions At, Bt, Ct which we do not observe.In the example of the pulse and the candle chandelier, we will not have the pulse and the candelabrum evolving in time, but only equations which tell us how the two variables evolve with respect to each other. That is to say, equations which tell us directly how many pulsebeats there are in an oscillation, without mentioning t.Physics without time is physics in which we speak only of the pulse and the chandelier, without mentioning time.Its a simple change but from a conceptual point of view, its a huge leap. We must learn to think of the world not as something which changes in time but in some other way. Things change only in relation to one another. At a fundamental level, there is no time. Our sense of the common passage of time is only an approximation which is valid for our macroscopic scale. It derives from the fact that we perceive the world in a coarsegrained fashion.The world described by the theory is thus far from the one we are familiar with. There is no longer space which contains the world, and no longer time during the course of which events occur. There are elementary processes in which the quanta of space and matter continuously interact with each other. Just as a calm and clear Alpine lake is made up of a rapid dance of a myriad of minuscule water molecules, the illusion of being surrounded by continuous space and time is the product of a longsighted vision of a dense swarming of elementary processes.Spacetime sushiHow do these general ideas apply to quantum gravity How can we describe change without the ideas of space as a container, or time along which the world glidesConsider a process: for example, the collision of two billiard balls on a tables green baize. Imagine a red ball played in the direction of a yellow one it gets close, collides, and the two balls move away in different directions. This process, like all processes, takes place in a finite zone of space lets say on a table approximately two metres wide and lasts for a finite interval of time lets say three seconds. To deal with this process in the context of quantum gravity, it is necessary to include space and time in the process itself figure ..We must not, in other words, describe only the two balls, but also all that is around them: the table and any other material objects and the space in which they are immersed during the time that elapses between the start of the shot and the end of the process. Space and time are the gravitational field, Einsteins mollusc: we are also including the gravitational field, that is to say, a piece of the mollusc, in the process. Everything is immersed in Einsteins great mollusc: here, imagine that you are slicing a small, finite portion of it, like a piece of sushi, which encompasses the collision and what surrounds it.Figure . A region of space in which a black ball hits a stationary white ball, propels it and rebounds. The box is the region of spacetime. Within it are drawn the trajectories of the balls.What we obtain from this is a spacetime box as in figure .: a finite portion of spacetime a few cubic metres in dimension by a few seconds of time. This process does not occur in time. The box is not in spacetime, it includes spacetime. It isnt a process in time, in the same way in which grains of space are not in space. The passage of time is only the measure of the process itself, just as quanta of gravity are not in space, as they themselves constitute space.The key to understanding how quantum gravity works lies in considering not solely the physical process given by the two balls but rather the entire process defined by the whole box with all that it entails, including the gravitational field.Now let us return to Heisenbergs original insight: quantum mechanics does not tell us what happens during the course of a process, but the probability which ties together the different initial and final states of the process. In our case, the initial and final states are given by all that happens at the border of the spacetime box.What the equations of loop quantum gravity give us is the probability associated with a given possible boundary of the box the probability that the balls will come out of the box in one particular configuration or another, if they have entered it in another.How is this probability computed Recall Feynmans sum over paths, which I described when speaking about quantum mechanics. Probabilities, in quantum gravity, can be calculated in the same way. By considering all the possible trajectories that have the same boundary. Since we are including the dynamics of spacetime, this means considering all possible spacetimes which have the same boundary as the box.Quantum mechanics assumes that between the initial boundary, where the two balls enter, and the final boundary where they exit, there is no definite spacetime nor definite trajectory of the balls. There is a quantum cloud in which all the possible spacetimes and all possible trajectories exist together. The probability of seeing the balls going out in one way or another can be computed by summing over all possible spacetimes.SpinfoamIf quantum space has the structure of a spin network, what structure will spacetime have What will one of the spacetimes previously alluded to in the calculation be likeIt must be a history of a spin network. Imagine that you take the graph of the spin network and move it: every node in the web draws a line, like the balls in figure ., and every line of the graph, moving, draws a surface for example, a moving segment draws a rectangle. But there is more: a node can open up into two or more nodes, just as a particle can split into two or more particles. Conversely, two or more nodes can combine into a single one. In this way, a graph which evolves draws an image like the one in figure ..Figure . An evolving spinnetwork: three nodes combine into a single node, and then separate again. On the right, the spinfoam representing this process.The image portrayed on the right of figure . is a spinfoam. Foam because it is made of surfaces which meet on lines, which in turn meet on vertices, resembling a foam of soap bubbles figure .. Spinfoam because the faces of the foam carry spins, as do the links of the graphs whose evolution they describe.Figure . The foam of soap bubbles.To compute the probability of a process, one must sum up over all the possible spinfoams within the box which have the same boundary as that process. The boundary of a spinfoam is a spin network and the matter on it.The equations of loop quantum gravity express the probability of a process in terms of sums over spinfoams with given boundaries. In this way it is possible to compute, in principle, the probability of any physical event.fnFigure . A vertex of spinfoam. Courtesy of Greg Egan.At first sight, this way for making calculations in quantum gravity, based on spinfoams, seems very different from the usual ways in which things are computed in theoretical physics. There is no given space, no given time, and spinfoams seem objects quite remote from, say, the particles of the standard model. But in fact there are strong similarities between the spinfoam technique and the calculation techniques used in the standard model. In fact, even more than this, the spinfoam technique is actually a beautiful merging of the two main calculation techniques used in the context of the standard model: Feynman diagrams and the lattice approximation.Feynman diagrams are used, for instance, to compute processes dominated by electromagnetic or weak forces. A Feynman diagram represents a sequence of elementary interactions among particles. An example is in figure ., which represents two particles, or two quanta of the field, interacting. The particle on the left splits into two particles, one of which splits in turn into two particles, which then reunite, converging with the particle on the right. The graph portrays a history of the fields quanta.Figure . A Feynman diagram.The lattice approximation is used when the forces are strong and the particle picture is no longer effective for describing physics, for instance in computing the strong forces between quarks inside the nucleus of an atom. The lattice technique entails approximating a continuous physical space by means of a lattice, or a grid, as in figure .. This grid is not assumed to be a faithful description of space, but only an approximation, as when engineers calculate the resistance of a bridge by approximating the concrete with a finite number of elements. These two methods of making calculations Feynman diagrams and the lattice are the two most efficient techniques of quantum field theory.Figure . A grid approximating physical spacetime.In quantum gravity, something beautiful occurs: the two methods of making calculations become one and the same. The spacetime foam represented in figure ., used to compute a physical process in quantum gravity, may be interpreted either as a Feynman diagram or as a lattice calculation.fn Therefore, the two calculation techniques used for the standard model turn out to be particular cases of a common technique: summing over the spinfoams of quantum gravity.Earlier, I set out Einsteins equations. Again, I cant resist including here the complete collection of the equations of loop theory, even if the reader will obviously not be able to decipher them not before undertaking the study of a good deal of mathematics. Someone once claimed that a theory isnt credible if its equations cannot be summarized on a Tshirt. Here is that Tshirt for loop quantum gravity figure ..Figure . The equations of loop quantum gravity, summarized on a Tshirt.These equationsfn are the mathematical version of the picture of the world I have given in the last two chapters. We are not at all sure if they are the correct equations but, in my opinion, they are the best account of quantum gravity we have at present.Space is a spin network whose nodes represent its elementary grains, and whose links describe their proximity relations. Spacetime is generated by processes in which these spin networks transform into one another, and these processes are described by sums over spinfoams. A spinfoam represents a history of a spin network, hence a granular spacetime where the nodes of the graph combine and separate.This microscopic swarming of quanta, which generates space and time, underlies the calm appearance of the macroscopic reality surrounding us. Every cubic centimetre of space, and every second that passes, is the result of this dancing foam of extremely small quanta.What is the world made ofThe backdrop of space has disappeared, time has disappeared, classic particles have disappeared, along with the classic fields. So what is the world made ofThe answer now is simple: the particles are quanta of quantum fields light is formed by quanta of a field space is nothing more than a field, which is also made of quanta and time emerges from the processes of this same field. In other words, the world is made entirely from quantum fields figure ..These fields do not live in spacetime they live, so to speak, one on top of the other: fields on fields. The space and time that we perceive in large scale are our blurred and approximate image of one of these quantum fields: the gravitational field.Fields that live on themselves, without the need of a spacetime to serve as a substratum, as a support, and which are capable by themselves of generating spacetime, are called covariant quantum fields. The substance of which the world is made has been radically simplified in recent years. The world, particles, light, energy, space and time all of this is nothing but the manifestation of a single type of entity: covariant quantum fields.Figure . What is the world made of Of only one ingredient: covariant quantum fields.Covariant quantum fields have become today the best description that we have of the , the apeiron, the primal substance of which everything is formed hypothesized by the man that could perhaps be called the first scientist and the first philosopher, Anaximander.fnThe separation between the curved and continuous space of Einsteins general relativity and the discrete quanta of quantum mechanics which dwell in a flat and uniform space has dissolved. The apparent contradiction is no longer there. Between the spacetime continuum and quanta of space, there is the same relationship as between electromagnetic waves and photons. The waves give an approximate largescale vision of photons. Photons are the way in which waves interact. Continuous space and time are an approximate largescale vision of the dynamic of quanta of gravity. The quanta of gravity are the way in which space and time interact. The same mathematics coherently describes the quantum gravitational field as other quantum fields.The conceptual price paid is the relinquishing of the idea of space, and of time, as general structures within which to frame the world. Space and time are approximations which emerge at a large scale. Kant was perhaps right when he affirmed that the subject of knowledge and its object are inseparable, but he was definitely mistaken when he considered Newtonian space and time as a priori forms of knowledge, parts of an indispensable grammar for understanding the world. This grammar has evolved, and is still in the process of evolving, with the growth of our knowledge.General relativity and quantum mechanics are, in the end, not as incompatible as they seemed. On closer inspection, they shake hands and engage in a beautiful dialogue. The spatial relations that weave Einsteins curved space are the very interactions weaving the relations between the systems of quantum mechanics. The two become compatible and conjoined, two sides of the same coin, as soon as it is recognized that space and time are aspects of a quantum field, and quantum fields can exist even without being grounded in an external space.This rarefied picture of the fundamental structure of the physical world is the vision of reality offered today by quantum gravity.The main reward of this kind of physics is that, as we shall see in the next chapter, infinity disappears. The infinitely small no longer exists. The infinities which plague conventional quantum field theory, predicated on the notion of a continuous space, now vanish, because they were generated precisely by the assumption, physically incorrect, of the continuity of space. The singularities which render Einsteins equations absurd when the gravitational field becomes too strong also disappear: they are only the result of neglecting the quantization of the field. Little by little, the pieces of the puzzle find their place. In the final sections of this book, I describe some of the physical consequences of this theory.It may appear strange and difficult to think of discrete elementary entities not in space and time, but weaving space and time with their relations. But how strange it must have seemed to listen to Anaximander, when he claimed that beneath our feet there was only the same sky that we can see above our heads Or to Aristarchus, when he tried to measure the distance from the Earth to the Moon and the Sun, discovering that they are extremely distant, and are therefore not the size of little balls, but gigantic and the Sun is immense compared to the Earth. Or to Hubble, when he realized that the small, diaphanous clouds between stars are vast seas of immensely distant stars For centuries, the world has continued to change and expand around us. We see further, understand it better and are astonished by its variety, by the limitations of the images we had of it. The description we manage to produce to account for it becomes increasingly rarefied, yet simple.We are akin to small, blind moles underground who know little or nothing about the world. But we continue to learn But all the story of the night told overAnd all their minds transfigured so togetherMore witnesseth than fancys imagesAnd grows to something of great constancyBut, howsoever, strange and admirable.Part Four D E D I have illustrated the basis of quantum gravity, and the image of the world which emerges from it. In the final chapters I describe some consequences of the theory: what the theory tells us about phenomena such as the Big Bang and black holes. I also discuss the current state of possible experiments to test the theory, and what it seems to me nature is telling us in particular with the failure of the expected observation of supersymmetric particles.I conclude with a few reflections on what is still missing from our understanding of the world: especially thermodynamics, the role of information in a theory without time and space such as quantum gravity, and the reemergence of time.All of this takes us to the edge of what we know, to the vantage point from which we look upon what we definitely dont know, the immense mystery that surrounds us.. Beyond the Big BangThe masterIn a young Belgian scientist, a Jesuiteducated Catholic priest, studies Einsteins equations and realizes just as Einstein had that they predict the universe must expand or contract. But instead of foolishly rejecting the result and stubbornly trying to avoid it, as Einstein did, the Belgian priest believes it and looks for astronomical data to test it.At the time, galaxies were not called galaxies. They were called nebulae because, seen through a telescope, they looked like small, opalescent clouds among the stars. It was not yet known that they are distant, immense islands of stars like our very own galaxy. But the young Belgian priest understands that the scarce available data on the galaxies were indeed compatible with the possibility that the universe is expanding: nearby galaxies are moving away at great speed, as if they had been launched into the sky distant galaxies are moving away at even greater speed. The universe is swelling like a balloon.Two years later, the insight is confirmed, thanks to two American astronomers, Henrietta Leavitt and Edwin Hubble. Leavitt discovers a good technique for measuring the distance of the nebulae, confirming that they are very far away, outside of our own galaxy. Using this technique and the great telescope of the Palomar Observatory, Hubble collects precise data that confirm that the galaxies are moving away, at a speed proportional to their distance.Figure . Henrietta Leavitt.But it is the young Belgian priest who understands, already in , the crucial consequence: if we see a stone flying up, it means that the stone was previously lower down and something has thrown it upwards. If we see the galaxies moving away and the universe expanding, it means that the galaxies were previously much closer and the universe was smaller: and something caused it to start expanding. The young Belgian priest suggests that the universe was originally extremely small and compressed, and started its expansion in a gigantic explosion. He calls this initial state the primordial atom. Today it is known as the Big Bang.His name was Georges Lematre. In French, this name sounds like le matre meaning the master, and few names are more appropriate for the man who first understood the existence of the Big Bang. But in spite of this name, Lematres character was reserved he avoided polemics, and never even claimed priority for the discovery of the expansion of the universe, which ended up being attributed to Hubble. Two episodes from his life illustrate his profound intelligence. The first involves Einstein, the second a pope.As mentioned, Einstein was sceptical about the expansion of the universe. He had grown up thinking that the universe is fixed, and had not been able to accept the idea that this was not the case. Even the greatest make mistakes and are prey to preconceived ideas. Lematre met Einstein and tried to dissuade him from his prejudicial view. Einstein resisted, going so far as to answer Lematre: Correct calculations, abominable physics. Later, Einstein was obliged to recognize that Lematre was the one who was actually right. It doesnt fall to everyone to disprove Einstein.Figure . Georges Lematre. Copyright Archives Georges Lematre, Louvain.The same thing happened again. Einstein had introduced the cosmological constant, the small but important modification of his equations I described in Chapter , in the mistaken hope of rendering the equations compatible with a static universe. When he had to acknowledge that the universe is not static, he turned against the cosmological constant. Lematre, for the second time, tried to persuade him to change his mind: the cosmological constant does not render the universe static, but it is nevertheless right, and there is no reason to take it out. On this occasion, too, Lematre was correct: the cosmological constant produces an acceleration of the expansion of the universe, and this acceleration has recently been measured. Once again, Einstein was wrong and Lematre was right.When the idea that the universe had emerged from a Big Bang began to be accepted, Pope Pius I declared in a public address on November that the theory confirmed the account of Creation given in Genesis. Lematre reacted to this papal position with great concern. He got in touch with the scientific advisor to the pontiff and went to great lengths to persuade the Pope to refrain from making references to links between divine creation and the Big Bang. Lematre was convinced that it was foolish to mix science and religion in this way: the Bible knows nothing about physics, and physics knows nothing about God. Pius I allowed himself to be persuaded, and the Catholic church never again made public allusion to the subject. It is not given to everyone to disprove the Pope.And of course, on this also, it was Lematre who was right: today there is a great deal of talk concerning the possibility that the Big Bang is not a real beginning, that there could have been another universe before it. Imagine in what an embarrassing position the Catholic Church would find itself today, if Lematre had not prevented the Pope from making it official doctrine that that Big Bang and Creation were the same thing. Fiat lux would have to be changed to Switch the light back on!To contest both Einstein and the Pope, convincing both that they were mistaken, and to be right in both cases, is surely something of a result. The master lived up to his name.Today confirmations are overwhelming: the universe, in a fardistant past, was extremely hot and extremely compact, and has expanded since. We can reconstruct in detail the history of the universe, starting with its initial hot, compressed state. We know how atoms, elements, galaxies and stars formed and how the universe as we see it today developed. Recent extended observations of the radiation that fills the universe carried out mainly by the Planck satellite once again confirmed in full the theory of the Big Bang. We know with a reasonable degree of certainty what happened on a large scale to our universe in the last billion years, from the time when it was a ball of fire.And to think that, initially, the phrase theory of the Big Bang was coined by opponents of the theory, to mock an idea that seemed outlandish Instead, in the end, we were all persuaded: billion years ago the universe was a compressed ball of fire.But what happened before this initial hot and compressed stateRegressing in time, temperature increases, as does the density of matter and energy. There is a point at which they reach the Planck scale: billion years ago. At that point, the equations of general relativity are no longer valid, because it is no longer possible to ignore quantum mechanics. We enter into the realm of quantum gravity.Quantum cosmologyTo understand what happened billion years ago, therefore, quantum gravity is required. What do the loops tell us about the subjectConsider an analogous but simpler situation. According to classical mechanics, an electron falling straight into an atomic nucleus would be swallowed by the nucleus and disappear. But this is not what happens in reality. Classic mechanics is incomplete, and it is necessary to take quantum effects into account. A real electron is a quantum object and does not follow a precise trajectory: it isnt possible to keep it inside too small a region. The more it is concentrated, the more it slips rapidly away. If we want to stop it around the nucleus, the most we can do is to force it into an orbit of the size of the smallest atomic orbital: it could not stay any closer to the nucleus. Quantum mechanics prevents a real electron from falling into a nucleus. A quantum repulsion pushes away the electron when it gets too close to the centre. Thus, thanks to quantum mechanics, matter is stable. Without it, electrons would fall into nuclei, there would be no atoms and we would not exist.The same applies to the universe. Let us imagine a universe contracting and becoming extremely small, squashed by its own weight. According to Einsteins equations, this universe would be squashed ad infinitum and at a certain point would disappear altogether, like the electron falling into the nucleus. This is the Big Bang predicted by Einsteins equations, if we ignore quantum theory.But if we take quantum mechanics into account, the universe cannot be indefinitely squashed. A quantum repulsion makes it rebound. A contracting universe does not collapse down to a point: it bounces back and begins to expand, as if it were emerging from a cosmic explosion figure ..Figure . The Big Bounce of the universe in a graphical representation by Francesca Vidotto, the Italian scientist who first used spinfoams to compute the probability of this process.The past of our universe may therefore well be the result of just such a rebound. A gigantic rebound known as a Big Bounce instead of Big Bang. This is what seems to emerge from the equations of loop quantum gravity when they are applied to the expansion of the universe.The image of the bounce must not be taken literally. Going back to the example of the electron, recall that if we want to place an electron as close as possible to an atom, the electron is no longer a particle we can think of it, instead, as opened up in a cloud of probabilities. An exact position no longer makes sense for the electron. The same for the universe: in the crucial passage through the Big Bounce, we can no longer think of a single, although granular, space and time, but only of a spreadout cloud of probabilities in which time and space wildly fluctuate. At the Big Bounce, the world is dissolved into a swarming cloud of probabilities, which the equations still manage to describe.Our universe could thus be the result of the collapse of a previous contracting universe passing across a quantum phase, where space and time are dissolved into probabilities.The word universe becomes ambiguous. If, by universe, we mean all that there is, then, by definition, there cannot be a second universe. But the word universe has assumed another meaning in cosmology: it refers to the spacetime continuum that we see directly around us, filled with galaxies the geometry and history of which we observe. There is no reason to be certain that, in this sense, this universe is the only one in existence. We can reconstruct the past up to the time when, as in the image by John Wheeler, the spatiotemporal continuum breaks up like sea foam and fragments into a quantum cloud of probabilities, and there is no reason to discard the possibility that beyond this hot foam there could not be another spatiotemporal continuum, similar to the one which we perceive around us.The probability for a universe to cross the phase of the Big Bounce, passing from contraction to expansion, can be computed using the techniques described in the preceding chapter: the spacetime boxes. Calculations are made using spinfoams that connect the contracting universe with the expanding one.All of this is still at an exploratory stage, but what is remarkable in this story is that today we have equations with which to try to describe these events. We are beginning to cast the first few cautious glances, for the moment only theoretically, beyond the Big Bang.. Empirical ConfirmationsThe appeal of quantum cosmology goes beyond the fascinating theoretical explorations of what there might be beyond the Big Bang. There is another reason for studying the application of the theory to cosmology: it might provide the opportunity to find out whether or not the theory is actually correct.Science works because, after hypotheses and reasoning, after intuitions and visions, after equations and calculations, we can check whether we have done well or not: the theory gives predictions about things we have not yet observed, and we can check whether these are correct, or not. This is the power of science, that which grounds its reliability and allows us to trust in it with confidence: we can check whether a theory is right or wrong. This is what distinguishes science from other kinds of thinking, where deciding who is right and who is wrong is usually a much thornier question, sometimes even devoid of meaning.When Lematre defends the idea that the universe is expanding, and Einstein does not believe it, one of the two is wrong the other right. All of Einsteins results, his fame, his influence on the scientific world, his immense authority, count for nothing. The observations prove him wrong, and its game over. An obscure Belgian priest is right. It is for this reason that scientific thinking has power.The sociology of science has shed light on the complexity of the process of scientific understanding like any other human endeavour, this process is beset by irrationality, intersects with the game of power and is affected by every sort of social and cultural influence. Nevertheless, despite all of this, and in opposition to the exaggerations of a few postmodernists, cultural relativists and the like, none of this diminishes the practical and theoretical efficacy of scientific thinking. Because in the end, in the majority of cases, it is possible to establish with clarity who is right and who is wrong. And even the great Einstein could go on to say and he did so, Ah I made a mistake! Science is the best strategy if we value reliability.This does not mean that science is just the art of making measurable predictions. Some philosophers of science overly circumscribe science by limiting it to its numerical predictions. They miss the point, because they confuse the instruments with the objectives. Verifiable quantitative predictions are instruments to validate hypotheses. The objective of scientific research is not just to arrive at predictions: it is to understand how the world functions to construct and develop an image of the world, a conceptual structure to enable us to think about it. Before being technical, science is visionary.The verifiable predictions are the sharpened tool which allows us to find out when we have misunderstood something. A theory lacking empirical confirmation is a theory which has not yet passed its exams. Exams never end, and a theory is not completely confirmed by one, two or three experiments. But it progressively acquires credibility, stage by stage, as its predictions are revealed to be correct. Theories such as general relativity and quantum mechanics, which initially left many perplexed, earned their credibility gradually, as all of their predictions even the most bizarre were gradually confirmed by experiments and observations.The importance of experimental proof, on the other hand, does not mean that, without new experimental data, we cannot make advances. It is often said that science takes steps forward only when there is new experimental data. If this were true, we would have little hope of finding the theory of quantum gravity before measuring something new, but this is patently not the case. Which new data were available to Copernicus None. He had the same data as Ptolemy. Which new data did Newton have Almost none. His real ingredients were Keplers laws and Galileos results. What new data did Einstein have to discover general relativity None. His ingredients were special relativity and Newtons theory. It simply isnt true that physics advances only when it is afforded new data.What Copernicus, Newton, Einstein and many others did was to build upon preexisting theories which synthesized empirical knowledge across vast fields of nature, and to find a way of combining and rethinking them to improve the general picture.This is the basis on which the best research on quantum gravity operates. The origin of knowledge, as always in science, is ultimately empirical. But the data on which quantum gravity is built is not new experiments: it is the theoretical edifices which have already structured our knowledge of the world, in forms which are only partly coherent. The experimental data for quantum gravity are general relativity and quantum mechanics. Building on these, trying to understand how a world in which both quanta and curved space exist may be made coherent, we attempt to look towards the unknown.The enormous success of the giants who have preceded us in similar situations, such as Newton, Einstein and Dirac, gives us encouragement. We do not presume to be of their stature. But we have the advantage of sitting on their shoulders, and this allows us to look further than they did. One way or another, we cannot but try.We must distinguish between clues and strong evidence. Clues are what set Sherlock Holmes on the right track, allowing him to solve a mysterious case. Strong evidence is what the judge needs to sentence the guilty. Clues put us on the right path towards a correct theory. Strong evidence is that which subsequently allows us to trust whether the theory we have built is a good one or not. Without clues, we search in the wrong directions. Without evidence, a theory is not reliable.The same applies to quantum gravity. The theory is in its infancy. Its theoretical apparatus is gaining solidity, and the fundamental ideas are being clarified: the clues are good, and concrete confirmed predictions are still missing. The theory has not yet taken its exams.Signals from natureThe most studied alternative to the research direction recounted in this book is string theory. The majority of physicists who have worked on string theory, or stringrelated theories, expected that as soon as the new particle accelerator at N in Geneva began to function the C or Large Hadron Collider, particles of a new kind never before observed, but anticipated by the theory, would immediately become evident: supersymmetric particles. String theory needs these particles to be consistent: that is why the string theorists eagerly expected them to be found. Loop quantum gravity, on the other hand, is well defined even without supersymmetric particles. The loop theorists were inclined to think that these particles might not exist.The supersymmetric particles were not observed, to the great disappointment of many. The fanfare that greeted the discovery of the Higgs boson in also masked this disappointment. The supersymmetric particles are not there at the energy where many string theorists expected them to be. This is not a definitive proof of anything far from it but nature has given a small clue in favour of the loops.There have been three major experimental results in fundamental physics in recent years. The first is the revelation of the Higgs boson at N in Geneva figure .. The second is the measurements made by the Planck satellite figure ., measurements, the data of which were also made public in , confirming the standard cosmological model. The third is the first detection of gravitational waves announced in the first months of . These are the three signals that nature has recently given us.Figure . An event at N which shows the formation of the Higgs particle.Figure . The Planck satellite.There is something in common between these three results: the complete absence of surprise. This does not diminish their importance: if anything, it makes them even more meaningful. The discovery of the Higgs boson is a rockhard confirmation of the validity of the ideas behind the standard model of elementary particles, based on quantum mechanics. It is the verification of a prediction made thirty years previously. The Planck measurements are a solid confirmation of the standard cosmological model, based on general relativity with the cosmological constant. The detection of gravitational waves is a spectacular confirmation of general relativity, a theory a hundred years old. The three results, obtained with strenuous technological efforts and extensive collaborations between hundreds of scientists, do nothing other than reinforce the understanding that we already had of the structure of the universe. No real surprises.But such an absence of surprises was in a sense itself surprising, because many expected to be surprised, that is, to see new physics, not yet described by established theories. They expected supersymmetry at , not the Higgs boson. And many expected that Planck would measure discrepancies from the standard cosmological model, discrepancies that would support alternative cosmological theories to general relativity.But no. What nature is confirming is simple: general relativity, quantum mechanics and, within quantum mechanics, the standard model.Many theoretical physicists are today looking for new theories by picking arbitrary hypotheses. Let us imagine that I dont think that this way of doing science has ever produced good results. Our fantasy is too limited to imagine how the world may be made, unless we search for inspiration in the traces we have at our disposal. The traces that we have our clues are either the theories which have been successful, or new experimental data, nothing else. It is in this data and in these theories that we must try to uncover what we have been unable yet to imagine. This is how Copernicus, Newton, Maxwell and Einstein proceeded. They never tried to guess a new theory unlike, in my opinion, the way in which too many theoretical physicists are trying to do today.The three recent experimental results I mentioned speak with the voice of Nature itself: Stop dreaming of new fields and strange particles supplementary dimensions, other symmetries, parallel universes, strings, and whatever else. The pieces of the puzzle are simpler: general relativity, quantum mechanics and the standard model. The next step forward may be only a question of combining them in the correct manner. Its reassuring advice for the loop quantum gravity community, because these are the hypotheses of the theory: general relativity, quantum mechanics and compatibility with the standard model, nothing else. The radical conceptual consequences the quanta of space, the disappearance of time are not bold hypotheses: they are the rational consequences that follow from taking the basic insights of our best theories seriously.Once again, these are not definitive proofs. Supersymmetric particles might finally exist, perhaps, at a scale still not reached, and could exist even if loop theory is correct. Supersymmetry failed to show up where expected, and string theorists are a little downcast, loop theorists are buoyant, but it is still a matter of clues there is no strong evidence at all.To find more concrete confirmation of the theory, we need to look elsewhere. The primordial universe could open the window to predictions capable of confirming the theory. In a not too distant future, we hope. Or they could prove the theory wrong.A window on to quantum gravityIf we have the equations that describe the transition of the universe across the quantum phase, we can compute effects of quantum phenomena upon the universe which we observe today. The universe is filled with cosmic radiation: a sea of photons remained in the cosmos since the early hot phase, the residual glare of the early high temperature.The electromagnetic field in the immense space between galaxies trembles like the surface of the sea after a big storm. This quivering, disseminated throughout the universe, is called the cosmic background radiation. It has been studied in the past few years by satellites such as , P and, most recently, Planck. An image of the minute fluctuations of this radiation is given in figure .. The details of the structure of this radiation tell us the history of the universe and, hidden in the folds of these details, there could be footprints of the quantum beginning of our universe.One of the most active sectors of research in loop quantum gravity is studying how the quantum dynamic of the primordial universe is reflected in this data. The results are preliminary, but encouraging. With more calculations and more precise measurements, it should be possible to arrive at a test of the theory.In Abhay Ashtekar, Ivan Agullo and William Nelson published an article in which they calculate that, under certain hypotheses, the statistical distribution of the fluctuations of this source of cosmic radiation should reveal the effect of the initial bounce: the wideangle fluctuations should be different from those predicted by the theory that does not take quanta into account. The current state of the measurement is described in figure ., where the black line represents the prediction by Ashtekar, Agullo and Nelson, and the grey dots the measured data. For now, these are not sufficient to evaluate whether the upward bend of the black line predicted by the three authors is correct or not. But measurements are getting more precise. The situation is still fluid. But those who, like myself, have spent their lives seeking to understand the secrets of quantum space are following with close attention, anxiety and hope the continuous honing of our capacity to make observations, to measure and to calculate and are awaiting the moment in which nature will tell us whether we are right or not.Figure . The fluctuations of the cosmic background radiation. This is the image of the oldest object in the universe available to us. These fluctuations were produced billion years ago. In the statistics of such fluctuations we hope to find confirmation of the predictions of quantum gravity.Figure . Possible prediction of the spectrum of background radiation, of loop quantum gravity shown by the solid line compared with the current experimental errors as represented by the points. Courtesy of . Ashtekar, . Agullo and . Nelson.Traces of the great primordial heat must also be in the gravitational field itself. The gravitational field, too, that is to say, space itself, must be tremulous like the surface of the sea. Therefore, a cosmic gravitational background radiation must also exist older even than the electromagnetic one, because the gravitational waves are disturbed less by matter than the electromagnetic ones and were able to travel undisturbed even when the universe was too dense to let the electromagnetic waves pass.We have now observed gravitational waves directly, with the O detector, formed by two arms of a few miles in length, at a right angle to each other, in which laser beams measure the distance between three fixed points. When a gravitational wave passes, the space lengthens and shortens imperceptibly, and the lasers reveal this minuscule variation.fn The gravitational waves observed were generated by an astrophysical event: colliding black holes. These are phenomena described by general relativity which do not involve quantum gravity. But a more ambitious experiment called A is at the stage of being evaluated and is capable of doing the same thing but on a much larger scale: by putting into orbit three satellites, not around the Earth but around the Sun, as if they were miniature planets tracking the Earth in its orbit. The three satellites are connected by laser beams measuring the distance between them or, better still, the variations in the distances when a gravitational wave passes. If A is launched, it should be able to see not only the gravitational waves produced by stars and black holes but also the diffuse background of primordial gravitational waves generated at a time close to the Big Bang. These waves should tell us about the quantum bounce.In the subtle irregularities of space, we should be able to find traces of events which took place billion years ago, at the origin of our universe, and confirm our deductions on the nature of space and time.. Quantum Black HolesBlack holes populate our universe in great number. They are regions in which space is so curved as to collapse in on itself, and where time comes to a standstill. As mentioned, they form, for instance, when a star has burned up all of the available hydrogen and collapses.Frequently, the collapsed star formed part of a pair of neighbouring stars and, in this case, the black hole and the surviving counterpart circle one around the other the black hole sucks matter from the other star continuously as in figure ..Astronomers have found many black holes with a size that is, mass of the order of our Sun a bit larger, in fact. But there are also gigantic back holes. There is one of these at the centre of almost all of the galaxies, including our own.Figure . Representation of a couple starblack hole. The star loses matter, which is partly absorbed by the black hole, partly projected by it in jets in the direction of its poles.The black hole at the centre of our own galaxy is currently being studied in detail. It has a mass a million times greater than our Sun. Every so often, a star gets too close to this monster, is disintegrated by the gravitational distortion and swallowed by the cyclopean black hole, like a small fish swallowed by a whale. Imagine a monster the size of a million Suns, which swallows in an instant our own Sun and its miniature planets There is a wonderful ongoing project to construct a network of radio antennae distributed across the Earth from pole to pole, with which astronomers will be able to achieve a resolution sufficient to see the galactic black hole. What we expect to see is a small black disc surrounded by the light produced by the radiation of the matter falling in.What enters a black hole does not come out again, at least if we neglect quantum theory. The surface of a black hole is like the present: it can be crossed only in one direction. From the future, there is no return. For a black hole, the past is the outside the future is the inside. Seen from outside, a black hole is like a sphere which can be entered but out of which nothing can come. A rocket could stay positioned at a fixed distance from this sphere, which is called the horizon of the black hole. To do so it needs to keep its engines firing intensely, to resist the gravitational pull of the hole. The powerful gravity of the hole implies that time slows down for this rocket. If the rocket stays near enough to the horizon for one hour, and then moves away, it would then find that, outside, in the meantime, centuries have passed. The closer the rocket stays to the horizon, the slower with respect to the outside time runs for it. Thus, travelling to the past is difficult, but travelling to the future is easy: we need only to get close to a black hole with a spaceship, keep within its vicinity for a while, and then move away.On the horizon itself, time stops: if we get extremely close to it and then move away after a few of our minutes, a million years might have elapsed in the rest of the universe.The really surprising thing is that the properties of these strange objects, today commonly observed, were foreseen by Einsteins theory. Now, astronomers study these objects in space, but until not long ago black holes were considered a scarcely credible and bizarre consequence of an outlandish theory. I remember my university professor introducing them as solutions to Einsteins equations, to which real objects were unlikely ever to correspond. This is the stupendous capacity of theoretical physics to discover things before they are observed.The black holes we observe are well described by Einsteins theory, and quantum mechanics is not needed to understand them. But there are two mysteries of black holes that do require quantum mechanics in order to be unravelled and, for each of these, loop theory offers a possible solution. One of these could also offer an opportunity to test the theory.The first application of quantum gravity to black holes concerns a curious fact discovered by Stephen Hawking. Early in the s he theoretically deduced that black holes are hot. They behave like hot bodies: they emit heat. In doing so, they lose energy and hence mass since energy and mass are the same thing, becoming progressively smaller. They evaporate. This evaporation of black holes is the most important discovery made by Hawking.Objects are hot because their microscopic constituents move. A hot piece of iron, for example, is a piece of iron where the atoms vibrate very rapidly around their equilibrium position. Hot air is air in which molecules move faster than in cold air.Figure . The surface of a black hole crossed by loops, that is to say, by links of the spin network that describe the state of the gravitational field. Each loop corresponds to a quantum area of the black holes surface. John Baez.What are the elementary atoms that vibrate, making a black hole hot Hawking left this problem unanswered. Loop theory provides a possible answer. The elementary atoms of a black hole that vibrate, and are thus responsible for its temperature, are the individual quanta of space on its surface.Thus, it is possible to understand the peculiar heat of black holes predicted by Hawking using loop theory: the heat is the result of the microscopic vibrations of the individual atoms of space. These vibrate because in the world of quantum mechanics everything vibrates nothing stays still. The impossibility of anything being entirely and continuously still in a place is at the heart of quantum mechanics. Blackhole heat is directly connected to loop quantum gravitys fluctuations of the atoms of space. The precise position of the black holes horizon is determined only in relation to these microscopic fluctuations of the gravitational field. Hence, in a certain sense, the horizon fluctuates like a hot body.There is another way of understanding the origin of the heat of black holes. The quantum fluctuations generate a correlation between the interior and the exterior of a hole. I will speak at length about correlations and temperature in Chapter . Quantum uncertainty across the horizon of the black hole generates fluctuations of the horizons geometry. But fluctuations imply probability, and probability implies thermodynamics, and therefore temperature. Concealing from us a part of the universe, a black hole makes its quantum fluctuations detectable in the form of heat.Figure . Stephen Hawking and Eugenio Bianchi. On the blackboard are the principal equations of loop quantum gravity which describe black holes.It was a young Italian scientist, Eugenio Bianchi, today a professor in the United States, who completed an elegant calculation which shows how, starting from these ideas and from the basic equations of loop quantum gravity, it is possible to derive the formula for the heat of black holes foreseen by Hawking figure ..The second application of loop quantum gravity to blackhole physics is more spectacular. Once collapsed, a star vanishes from external view: it is inside the black hole. But, inside the hole, what happens to it What would you see if you let yourself fall into the holeAt first, nothing in particular: you would cross the surface of the black hole without major injuries then you would plummet towards the centre, at ever greater speed. And then General relativity predicts that everything is squashed at the centre into an infinitely small point of infinite density. But this is, once again, if we ignore quantum theory.If we take quantum gravity into account, this prediction is no longer correct there is quantum repulsion the same repulsion that makes the universe bounce at the Big Bang. What we expect is that, on getting closer to the centre, the falling matter is slowed down by this quantum pressure, up to a very high but finite density. Matter gets squashed, but not all the way to an infinitely small point, because there is a limit to how small things can be. Quantum gravity generates a huge pressure that makes matter bounce out, precisely as a collapsing universe can bounce out into an expanding universe.The bounce of a collapsing star can be very fast, if watched from down there. But remember time passes much more slowly there than outside. Seen from the outside, the process of the bounce can take billions of years. After this time, we can see the black hole explode. In the end, basically, this is what a black hole is: a shortcut to the distant future.Thus, quantum gravity might imply that black holes are not eternally stable objects, as classical general relativity predicted, after all. They are, ultimately, unstable.Seeing these blackhole explosions would be a spectacular confirmation for the theory. Very old black holes, such as those formed in the early universe, could be exploding today. Some recent calculations suggest that the signals of their explosion could be in the range of radio telescopes. It has even been suggested that certain mysterious radio pulses which radio astronomers have already measured, called Fast Radio Bursts, could be, precisely, signals generated by the explosion of primordial black holes. If this was confirmed, it would be fantastic: we would have a direct sign of a quantum gravitational phenomenon. Lets wait and see . The End of InfinityWhen we take quantum gravity into account, the infinite compression of the universe into a single, infinitely small point predicted by general relativity at the Big Bang disappears. Quantum gravity is the discovery that no infinitely small point exists. There is a lower limit to the divisibility of space. The universe cannot be smaller than the Planck scale, because nothing exists which is smaller than the Planck scale.If we ignore quantum mechanics, we ignore the existence of this lower limit. The pathological situations predicted by general relativity, where the theory gives infinite quantities, are called singularities. Quantum gravity places a limit to infinity, and cures the pathological singularities of general relativity.The same happens at the centre of black holes: the singularity that classic general relativity anticipated disappears as soon as we take quantum gravity into account.There is another case, of a different kind, in which quantum gravity places a limit to the infinite, and it regards forces such as electromagnetism. Quantum field theory, started by Dirac and completed in the s by Feynman and his colleagues, describes these forces well but is full of mathematical absurdities. When we use it to compute physical processes, we often obtain results which are infinite, and mean nothing. They are called divergences. The divergences are then eliminated with calculations, using a baroque technical procedure which leads to finite final results. In practice, it works, and the numbers, in the end, come out right they reproduce the experimental measurements. But why must the theory go via the infinite to arrive at reasonable numbersIn the last years of his life, Dirac was very unhappy with the infinities in his theory and felt that, all things considered, his objective of truly understanding how things worked was not achieved. Dirac loved conceptual clarity, even if what was clarity to him was not always clarity to others. But infinities do not make for clarity.But the infinities of quantum field theory follow from an assumption at the basis of the theory: the infinite divisibility of space. For example, to calculate the probabilities of a process, we sum up as Feynman has taught us all of the ways in which the process could unfold, and these are infinite, because they can happen in any one of the infinite points of a spatial continuum. This is why the result can be infinite.When quantum gravity is taken into account, these infinities also disappear. The reason is clear: space is not infinitely divisible, there are no infinite points there are no infinite things to add up. The granular discrete structure of space resolves the difficulties of the quantum theory of fields, eliminating the infinities by which it is afflicted.This is a tremendous result: on the one hand, taking quantum mechanics into account resolves the problems generated by the infinities of Einsteins theory of gravity, that is to say, the singularities. On the other, taking gravity into account solves the problems generated by quantum field theory, that is to say, the divergences. Far from being contradictory, as they at first seemed, the two theories each offer the solution to the problems posed by the other!Putting a limit to infinity is a recurrent theme in modern physics. Special relativity may be summarized as the discovery that there exists a maximum velocity for all physical systems. Quantum mechanics can be summarized as the discovery that there exists a maximum of information for each physical system. The minimum length is the Planck length , the maximum velocity is the speed of light c, and the total information is determined by the Planck constant h. This is summarized in table ..The existence of these minimum and maximum values for length, velocity and action fixes a natural system of units. Instead of measuring speed in kilometres per hour, or in metres per second, we can measure it in fractions of the speed of light. We can fix the value for the velocity c and write, for example, v , for a body which is moving at half the speed of light. In the same way, we can posit by definition and measure length in multiples of Plancks length. And we can posit h and measure actions in multiples of Plancks constant. In this way, we have a natural system of fundamental unities from which the others follow. The unity of time is the time that light takes to cover the Planck length, and so on. The natural unities are commonly used in research on quantum gravity.The identification of these three fundamental constants places a limit to what seemed to be the infinite possibilities of nature. It suggests that what we call infinite often is nothing more than something which we have not yet counted, or understood. I think this is true in general. Infinite, ultimately, is the name that we give to what we do not yet know. Nature appears to be telling us that there is nothing truly infinite.Table . Fundamental limitations discovered by theoretical physics.Physical Quantity Fundamental constant Theory DiscoveryVelocity c Special relativity A maximum velocity existsInformation actions Quantum mechanics A minimum of information existsLength Lp Quantum gravity A minimum length existsThere is another infinity which disorientates our thinking: the infinite spatial extension of the cosmos. But as I illustrated in Chapter , Einstein has found the way of thinking of a finite cosmos without borders. Current measurements indicate that the size of the cosmos must be larger than billion light years. This is the order of magnitude of the universe we have indirect access to. It is around times greater than the Planck length, a number of times which is given by a followed by zeroes. Between the Planck scale and the cosmological one, then, there is the mindblowing separation of orders of magnitude. Huge. Extraordinarily huge. But finite.In this space between the size of the minute quanta of space, up to quarks, protons, atoms, chemical structures, mountains, stars, galaxies each formed by one hundred billion stars, clusters of galaxies, and right up until the seemingly boundless visible universe of more than billion galaxies unfolds the swarming complexity of our universe a universe we know only in a few aspects. Immense. Finite.The cosmological scale is reflected in the value of the cosmological constant , which enters into the basic equations of our theories. The fundamental theory contains, therefore, a very large number: the ratio between the cosmological constant and the Planck length. It is this large number that opens the way to the vast complexity of the world. But what we see and understand of the universe is not an infinity to drown in. It is a wide sea, but a finite one.The book of Ecclesiasticus, or Sirach,fn opens with a stupendous question:Who can number the sand of the sea, and the drops of rain, and the days of eternity Who can find out the height of heaven, and the breadth of the earth, and the deep, and wisdomNot much longer after these lines were composed, another great text was written, with an opening which still resounds:Some think, O King Hiero, that the grains of sand cannot be counted.This is the opening of Psammites The Sand Reckoner by Archimedes, in which the greatest scientist of antiquity counts the grains of sand in the universe!He does so in order to demonstrate that their number is large but finite, and can be determined. The numerical system of antiquity did not allow for dealing with very large numbers easily. In The Sand Reckoner, Archimedes develops a new system of numbering, similar to our exponentials, that makes it possible to deal with very large numbers, and shows its power by counting certainly playfully how many grains of sand there are, not just on the seashores but in the entire universe.The Sand Reckoner is playful, but profound. With a flight of fancy that seems to anticipate the Enlightenment by millennia, Archimedes rebels against the form of knowledge that insists on there being mysteries which are intrinsically inaccessible to human thought. He does not claim to know the exact dimensions of the universe, or the precise number of grains of sand. It isnt the completeness of his knowledge that he is asserting. On the contrary, he is explicit about the approximate and provisional nature of his estimates. He speaks about possible alternatives regarding the true size of the universe between which he does not make a definite choice. The point at stake here is not the presumption of knowing everything. It is the opposite: an awareness that yesterdays ignorance may have light shed on it today, and that todays might be illuminated tomorrow.The central point is rebellion against the renunciation of the desire to know: a declaration of faith in the comprehensibility of the world, a proud retaliation to those who remain satisfied with their own ignorance, who call infinite that which we dont understand and delegate knowledge to elsewhere.Centuries have passed, and the text of Ecclesiasticus, along with the rest of the Bible can be found in countless homes, while Archimedes text is read only by the few. Archimedes was slaughtered by the Romans during the sacking of Syracuse, the last proud remnant of Magna Grecia to fall under the Roman yoke, during the expansion of that future empire which would soon adopt Ecclesiasticus as one of the foundational texts of its official religion, a position which it was to occupy there for more than a thousand years. During that millennium, the calculations made by Archimedes languished in a state of incomprehensibility: no one was able to use, or even to understand them.Near Archimedes Syracuse there is one of the most beautiful sites in Italy, the theatre of Taormina, which looks out at the Mediterranean and upon Mount Etna, the smoking volcano. In Archimedes time, the theatre was used to stage plays by Sophocles and Euripides. The Romans adapted it for gladiatorial combat, for the pleasure of watching gladiators die.The sophisticated playfulness of The Sand Reckoner is perhaps not only about an audacious mathematical construction, or the virtuosity of one of the most extraordinary minds of antiquity. It is also a defiant cry of reason, which recognizes its own ignorance but refuses to delegate to others the source of knowledge. It is a small, reserved and powerfully intelligent manifesto against infinity against obscurantism.Quantum gravity is one of the many lines that continue the quest of The Sand Reckoner. We are counting the grains of space of which the cosmos is made. A vast cosmos, but a finite one.The only truly infinite thing is our ignorance.. InformationWe are approaching the conclusion of our journey. In the previous few chapters, I spoke about the concrete applications of quantum gravity: the description of what happened to the universe around the time of the Big Bang the description of the properties of the heat of black holes and the suppression of infinity.Before concluding, I would like to return to the theory, but looking at its future, and to speak about information: a spectre that is haunting theoretical physics, arousing enthusiasm and confusion.This chapter is different from the preceding ones, where I spoke of ideas and theories not yet tested but well defined here, Im speaking of ideas still confused, badly in need of organization. If, dear reader, you have found the journey so far a little rough, then hold on tighter, because were now flying between voids of air. If this chapter seems particularly opaque, its not because your ideas are confused. Its because the one with the confused ideas is me.Many scientists suspect today that the concept of information may turn out to be a key for new advances in physics. Information is mentioned in the foundations of thermodynamics, the science of heat, the foundation of quantum mechanics and in other areas besides, with the word quite often used very imprecisely. I believe there is something important in this idea. Ill try to explain why, and to show what information has to do with quantum gravity.Before anything else, what is information The word information is used in common parlance to mean a variety of different things, and this imprecision is a source of confusion in science as well. The scientific notion of information, however, was defined with clarity in , by the American mathematician and engineer Claude Shannon, and is something very simple: information is the measure of the number of possible alternatives for something. For example, if I throw a die, it can land on one of six faces. When weve seen it fall on a particular one of these, we have an amount of information N , because the possible alternatives are six in number. If I dont know which day of the year is your birthday there are distinct possibilities. If you tell me the date, I have the information N . And so on.Instead of the number of alternatives , scientists measure information in terms of a quantity called , for Shannon information. S is defined as the logarithm in base of : S log . The advantage of using the logarithm is that the unit of measurement S corresponds to N because log , making the unit of information the minimum number of alternatives: the choice between two possibilities. This unit of measurement is called bit. When I know at roulette that a red number has come up rather than a black, I have one bit of information when I know that a red, even number has won, I have two bits of information when an even red number manque eighteen or less, in roulette parlance wins, I have three bits. Two bits of information correspond to four alternatives red even, red uneven, black even, black uneven. Three bits of information correspond to eight alternatives. And so on.fnA key point is that information can be located somewhere. Imagine, for instance, that you have in your hand a ball which can be either black or white. Imagine that I also have a ball which can be either black or white. There are two possibilities on my part, and two on yours. The total number of possibilities is four x : whitewhite whiteblack blackwhite and blackblack. Now, suppose that for some reason we are certain that the two balls are opposite in colour for instance, because we have taken the balls from a box that contained only one white and one black ball. The total number of alternatives is then only whiteblack or blackwhite, even if the alternatives are still two on my part and two on yours. Note that, in this situation, something peculiar happens: if you look at your ball, then you know the colour of mine. In this case, we say that the colours of the two balls are correlated, that is to say, linked to one another. We say that my ball has information about yours as well as vice versa.If you think about it, this is precisely what happens in life when we communicate: for example, when I phone you, I know that the phone causes the sounds on your side to be dependent on the sounds on mine. The sounds on both sides are linked, like the colour of the balls.The example is not chosen at random: Shannon, who invented the theory of information, worked for a telephone company, and was looking for a way to measure accurately how much a telephone line could carry. But what does a telephone line carry It carries information. It carries the capacity to distinguish between alternatives. For this reason, Shannon defined information.Why is the notion of information useful, perhaps even fundamental, to understanding the world For a subtle reason: because it measures the ability of one physical system to communicate with another physical system.Lets return for a final time to the atoms of Democritus. Lets imagine a world formed of an interminable sea of atoms which bounce, attract and cling together, and of nothing else. Arent we missing somethingPlato and Aristotle insisted on the fact that something was indeed missing they thought that the form of things was this something extra that had to be added to the substance of which things were made in order to understand the world. For Plato, forms exist by themselves, in an ethereal ideal world of forms, a world of ideas. The idea of a horse exists prior to and independently of any actual horse. For Plato, a real horse is nothing but a pale reflection of the idea of a horse. The atoms which make up the horse count for little: what counts is the horseness, the abstract form. Aristotle is a bit more realistic, but for him, too, the form cannot be reduced to the substance. In a statue, there is more than the stone of which it is made. This more, for Aristotle, is the form. This is the basis of the critique of Democrituss materialism in antiquity. It still remains a common critique of materialism.But was Democritus really proposing that everything can be reduced to atoms Lets look at it more closely. Democritus says that when atoms combine what counts is their form, their arrangement in the structure, as well as the way in which they combine. He gives the example of the letters of the alphabet: there are only twenty or so letters but, as he puts it, It is possible for them to combine in diverse modes, in order to produce comedies or tragedies, ridiculous stories or epic poems.There are more than just atoms in this idea: what counts is the way in which they are combined, one in relation to another. But what relevance can the way in which they are combined have, in a world in which there is nothing but other atomsIf the atoms are also an alphabet, who is able to read the phrases written with this alphabetThe answer is subtle: the way in which the atoms arrange themselves is correlated with the way other atoms arrange themselves. Therefore, a set of atoms can have information, in the technical, precise sense described above, about another set of atoms.This, in the physical world, happens continuously and throughout, in every moment and in every place: the light which arrives at our eyes carries information about the objects which it has played across the colour of the sea has information on the colour of the sky above it a cell has information about the virus that is attacking it a new living being has plenty of information because it is correlated with its parents, and with its species and you, dear reader, when reading these lines, receive information about what I am thinking while writing them, that is to say, about what is happening in my mind at the moment in which I write this text. What occurs in the atoms of your brain is not any more independent from what is happening in the atoms of mine: we communicate.The world isnt, then, just a network of colliding atoms: it is also a network of correlations between sets of atoms, a network of real reciprocal information between physical systems.In all of this, there is nothing idealistic or spiritual its nothing but an application of Shannons idea that alternatives can be counted. All this is as much a part of the world as the stones of the Dolomites, the buzzing of bees and the waves of the sea.Once we have understood that this network of reciprocal information exists in the universe, it is natural to seek to use this treasure to describe the world. Lets start with an aspect of nature well understood since the end of the nineteenth century: heat. What is heat What does it mean to say that something is hot Why does a cup of scaldinghot tea cool itself down, rather than heating itself up furtherIt was the Austrian scientist Ludwig Boltzmann, the founder of statistical mechanics, who first understood why.fn Heat is the random microscopic movement of molecules: when the tea is hotter, the movement of the molecules is more agitated. Why does it cool down Boltzmann hazarded a splendid hypothesis: because the number of possible states of the molecules in hot tea and cold air is smaller than the number in cool tea and slightly warmer air. The combined state evolves from a situation where there are less possible states to a situation where there are more possible states. The tea cant warm itself up, because information cannot increase by itself.Ill elaborate. The molecules of tea are extremely numerous and extremely small, and we dont know their precise movements. Therefore, we lack information. This lack of information or missing information can be computed. Boltzmann did it: he computed the number of distinct states the molecules can be in. This number depends on the temperature. If the tea cools, a little of its energy passes into the surrounding air therefore, the molecules of tea move more slowly and the molecules of air move more quickly. If you compute your missing information, you discover that it has increased. If, instead, tea absorbed heat from the colder air, then the missing information would be decreased. That is, we would know more. But information cannot fall from the sky. It cannot increase by itself, because what we dont know, we just dont know. Therefore, the tea cannot warm up by itself in contact with cold air. It sounds a bit magical, but it works: we can predict how heat behaves just on the basis of the observation that our information cannot increase for free!Boltzmann was not taken seriously. At the age of fiftysix, in Duino, near Trieste, he committed suicide. Today, he is considered one of the geniuses of physics. His tomb is incised with his formulaS k log Wwhich expresses missing information as the logarithm of the number of alternatives, Shannons key idea. Boltzmann pointed out that this quantity coincides with the entropy used in thermodynamics. Entropy is missing information, that is, information with a minus sign. The total amount of entropy can only increase, because information can only diminish.fnToday, physicists commonly accept the idea that information can be used as a conceptual tool to throw light on the nature of heat. More audacious, but defended today by an increasing number of theorists, is the idea that the concept of information can be useful also to the mysterious aspects of quantum mechanics illustrated in Chapter .Remember that a key result of quantum mechanics is precisely the fact that information is finite. The number of alternative results that we can obtain measuring a physical systemfn is infinite in classical mechanics but, thanks to quantum theory, we have understood that, in reality, it is finite. Quantum mechanics can be understood as the discovery that information in nature is always finite.In fact, the entire structure of quantum mechanics can be read and understood in terms of information, as follows. A physical system manifests itself only by interacting with another. The description of a physical system, then, is always given in relation to another physical system, the one with which it interacts. Any description of a system is therefore always a description of the information which a system has about another system, that is to say, the correlation between the two systems. The mysteries of quantum mechanics become less dense if interpreted in this way, as the description of the information that physical systems have about one another.The description of a system, in the end, is nothing other than a way of summarizing all the past interactions with it, and using them to predict the effect of future interactions.The entire formal structure of quantum mechanics can in large measure be expressed in two simple postulates:The relevant information in any physical system is finite.You can always obtain new information on a physical system.Here, the relevant information is the information that we have about a given system as a consequence of our past interactions with it: information allowing us to predict what will be the result for us of future interactions with this system. The first postulate characterizes the granularity of quantum mechanics: the fact that a finite number of possibilities exists. The second characterizes its indeterminacy: the fact that there is always something unpredictable which allows us to obtain new information. When we acquire new information about a system, the total relevant information cannot grow indefinitely because of the first postulate, and part of the previous information becomes irrelevant, that is to say, it no longer has any effect upon predictions of the future. In quantum mechanics when we interact with a system, we dont only learn something, we also cancel a part of the relevant information about the system.fnThe entire formal structure of quantum mechanics follows in large measure from these two simple postulates. Therefore, the theory lends itself in a surprising way to being expressed in terms of information.The first to realize that the notion of information was fundamental to the understanding of quantum reality was John Wheeler, the father of quantum gravity. Wheeler coined the phrase It from bit to express this idea, meaning that everything is information.Information reappears, then, in the context of quantum gravity. Remember: the area of any surface is determined by the spins of the loop which intersect this surface. These spins are discrete quantities, and each one contributes to the area.A surface with a fixed area may be formed from these elementary quanta of area in many different ways, say, in a number of ways . If you know the area of a surface but dont know exactly how its quanta of area are distributed, you have missing information about the surface. This is one of the ways of computing the heat of black holes: the quanta of area of a black hole enclosed in a surface of a certain area can be in N different possible distributions. It is like for the cup of tea, in which the molecules can move in N different possible ways. Thus we can associate a quantity of missing information, that is to say, entropy, with a black hole.The amount of information associated thus with a black hole depends directly upon the area A of the hole: the larger the hole, the greater the amount of missing information.When information enters into a black hole, it is no longer recoverable from outside. But the information which enters the black hole carries with it the energy by which the black hole becomes larger and increases its area. Viewed from outside, the information lost in the black hole now appears as entropy associated with the area of the hole. The first to suspect something similar was the Israeli physicist Jacob Bekenstein.But the situation is anything but clear because, as we have seen in the last chapter, black holes emit thermal radiation and very slowly evaporate, becoming smaller and smaller until they probably disappear, subsumed in that ocean of microscopic black holes which constitutes space at the Planck scale. Where does the information that has fallen into the black hole as the black hole shrinks end up Theoretical physicists are debating the question, and no one has a completely clear answer.All of this, I believe, indicates that in order to grasp the basic grammar of the world, we need to merge three basic ingredients, not just two: not just general relativity and quantum mechanics, but also the theory of heat, that is, statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, which we can also describe as information theory. But the thermodynamics of general relativity, that is to say, the statistical mechanics of quanta of space, is as yet only in its first infancy. Everything is still confused, and there is a very great deal which remains to be understood.All of this brings us to the last idea I describe in this book: thermal time.Thermal timeThe problem at the root of the idea of thermal time is simple. In Chapter , I showed that it is not necessary to use the notion of time to describe physics. It is better to forget time altogether. Time plays no role at the fundamental level of physics. Once we have understood this, it is easier to write the equations of quantum gravity.There are many everyday notions which no longer have any role in the fundamental equations of the universe for example, the notions of up and down, or hot and cold, so it is not particularly strange that shared quotidian notions disappear from fundamental physics. However, once we have accepted this idea, we obviously open up a second problem. How can we recover the notions of our everyday experience How do they emerge, in our specific contextFor example, the notions of up and down dont enter into Newtons equations, but we know what they mean in a schema without absolute up and down. Up and down are meaningful near a large mass, like a planet. Down indicates the direction towards which the large, near mass exerts gravitational pull up indicates the opposite direction. The same goes for hot and cold: there are no hot or cold things at a microscopic level but, when we put together a large number of microscopic constituents and describe them in terms of averages, then the notion of heat appears: a hot body is a body where the average speed of single constituents is raised. We are able to understand the meaning of up or hot in certain situations: the presence of a nearby mass, or the fact that we are dealing only with average values of many molecules, and so on.Something similar must apply to time. If the notion of time has no role to play at an elementary level, it certainly plays a significant role in our lives, just as up and hot do. What does the passage of time mean, if time plays no part in the fundamental description of the worldThe answer is simple. The origin of time may be similar to that of heat: it comes from averages of many microscopic variables. Lets look at this in detail.That there is a link between time and temperature is an ancient and recurrent idea. If you think about it, all phenomena where we detect the passage of time are coinvolved with temperature. The salient characteristic of time is that it moves forwards and not backwards, that is to say, there are irreversible phenomena. Mechanical phenomena ones that dont involve heat are reversible. If we film them and then run the film backwards, we see something realistic. If we film a swinging pendulum, or a stone thrown upwards then falling, and then watch the film in reverse, we still see a plausible pendulum swinging, or a stone rising and dropping to the ground.When the stone reaches the ground, it stops, you might object: if you watch the film reversed, you see a stone leaping up from the ground by itself, and this is implausible. But when the stone reaches the ground and stops, where does its energy go It heats the ground! At the precise moment when heat is produced, the process is irreversible: the past differs from the future. It is always heat and only heat that distinguishes the past from the future.This is universal. A burning candle is transformed into smoke the smoke cannot transform into a candle and a candle produces heat. A boilinghot cup of tea cools down and does not heat up: it diffuses heat. We live and get old: producing heat. Our old bicycle wears out with time: producing heat through friction. Think of the solar system. At first approximation, it continues to turn like an immense mechanism always equal to itself. It doesnt produce heat and, in fact, if you watched it in reverse you wouldnt notice anything strange about it. But looked at more closely, there are also irreversible phenomena: the Sun is using up its combustible hydrogen and will eventually exhaust it and extinguish: the Sun, too, is getting older and, in fact, produces heat. The Moon also appears to orbit the Earth unchangingly and be always equal to itself, whereas in reality it is slowly moving away. This is because it raises tides, and the tides heat the sea a little, thus exchanging energy with the Moon. Whenever you consider a phenomenon certifying the passage of time, it is through the production of heat that it does so. There is no preferred direction of time without heat.But heat is our way to name averages over many variables.The idea of thermal time reverses this observation. That is to say, instead of enquiring how time produces dissipation in heat, it asks how heat produces time.Thanks to Boltzmann, we know that the notion of heat comes from the fact that we interact with averages. The idea of thermal time is that the notion of time, too, comes from the fact that we interact only with averages of many variables.fnAs long as we have a complete description of a system, all the variables of the system are on the same footing none of them acts as a time variable. That is to say: none is correlated to irreversible phenomena. But as soon as we describe the system by means of averages of many variables, we have a preferred variable that functions like common time. A time along which heat is dissipated. The time of our everyday experience.Hence time is not a fundamental constituent of the world, but it appears because the world is immense, and we are small systems within the world, interacting only with macroscopic variables that average among innumerable small, microscopic variables. We, in our everyday lives, never see a single elementary particle, or a single quantum of space. We see stones, mountains, the faces of our friends and each of these things we see is formed by myriads of elementary components. We are always correlated with averages. Averages behave like averages: they disperse heat and, intrinsically, generate time.The difficulty of grasping this idea comes from the fact that it is hard for us to think of a world without time, and of time emerging in an approximate manner. We are too used to thinking of reality as existing in time. We are beings who live in time: we dwell in time, and are nourished by it. We are an effect of this temporality, produced by average values of microscopic variables. But the limitations of our intuitions should not mislead us. Understanding the world better often entails going against intuition. If this were not the case, understanding would be easy.Time is an effect of our overlooking of the physical microstates of things. Time is information we dont have.Time is our ignorance.Reality and informationWhy does information play such a central role as this Perhaps because we must not confuse what we know about a system with the absolute state of the same system. What we know is something concerning the relation between the system and ourselves. Knowledge is intrinsically relational it depends just as much on its object as upon its subject. The notion of the state of a system refers, explicitly or implicitly, to another system. Classical mechanics misled us into thinking that we could do without taking account of this simple truth, and that we could access, at least in theory, a vision of reality entirely independent of the observer. But the development of physics has shown that, at the end of the day, this is impossible.Careful: when I say that we have information about the temperature of cup of tea, or we dont have information about the velocity of every single molecule, I am not saying something about mental states, or abstract ideas. I am only saying that the laws of physics determine a correlation between ourselves and the temperature for instance, Ive looked at a thermometer, but not between ourselves and the velocity of the individual molecules. It is the same notion of information as the one I started from in this chapter: the white ball in your hand has information about the fact that the ball in my hand is black. Were dealing with physical facts, not mental notions. A ball has information, in this sense, even if the ball does not have mental states, just as a B storage device contains information the number of gigabytes printed on the device tells us how much information it can contain, even if a B storage device does not think. Information in this sense correlation between states of systems is ubiquitous throughout the universe.I believe that in order to understand reality we have to keep in mind that reality is this network of relations, of reciprocal information, which weaves the world. We slice up the reality surrounding us into objects. But reality is not made up of discrete objects. It is a variable flux. Think of an ocean wave. Where does a wave finish Where does it begin Think of mountains. Where does a mountain start Where does it end How far does it continue beneath the Earths surface These are questions without much sense, because a wave and a mountain are not objects in themselves they are ways which we have of slicing up the world to apprehend it, to speak about it more easily. These limits are arbitrary, conventional, comfortable: they depend on us as physical systems more than on the waves or the mountains. They are ways of organizing the information which we have or, better, forms of information which we have.Its the same for every object, properly considered, including living organisms. This is why it makes little sense to ask whether a halfcut fingernail is still me or has become notme or if the hairs left on my sofa by the cat are still part of the cat, or not or precisely when a childs life begins. A child begins to live on the day when a person dreams of her for the first time, long before her conception, or when she forms her first selfimage, or when she breathes for the first time, or when she recognizes her name, or when we apply any number of other conventions: they are all useful, but arbitrary. They are ways to think, and to orientate ourselves within the complexity of reality.A living organism is a system which continually reforms itself in order to remain itself, interacting ceaselessly with the external world. Of such organisms, only those continue to exist which are more efficient at doing so and, therefore, living organisms manifest properties which have suited them for survival. For this reason, they are interpretable, and we interpret them, in terms of intentionality, of purpose. The finalistic aspects of the biological world this is Darwins momentous discovery are therefore the result of the selection of complex forms effective in persisting. But the effective way of continuing to exist in a changing environment is to manage correlations with the external world better, that is to say, information to collect, store, transmit and elaborate information. For this reason, A exists, together with immune systems, sense organs, nervous systems, complex brains, languages, books, the library of Alexandria, computers and Wikipedia: they maximize the efficiency of information management the management of correlations favouring survival.The statue that Aristotle sees in a block of marble is more than the block of marble: but it is not an abstract form that resides just in the statue. It is something residing in the correlations between the mind of Aristotle, or ours, and the marble something that pertains to the information which the marble provides regarding something that is significant for Aristotle, or for us. It is something regarding a discus thrower, Phidias, Aristotle and the marble, and resides in the correlated dispositions of the atoms of the statue, and the correlations between these and a thousand others, in our minds or in Aristotles. These speak of a discus thrower, just as the white ball in your hand tells you that the ball in mine is black. We are structured to manage precisely this information and remain in existence thanks to this.Even from this brief overview it should be clear that the notion of information plays a central role in our attempts to understand the world. From communication to the basis of genetics, from thermodynamics to quantum mechanics and up to quantum gravity, the notion of information is gaining ground as a tool for understanding. The world should not be understood as an amorphous ensemble of atoms but rather as a game of mirrors, founded on the correlations between the structures formed by combinations of these atoms.As Democritus said, it is not just a question of these atoms but also of the order in which they are arranged. Atoms are like the letters in an alphabet: an extraordinary alphabet, so rich as to be able to read, reflect and even think about itself. We are not atoms we are orders in which atoms are arranged, capable of mirroring other atoms and mirroring ourselves.Democritus gave a strange definition of man: Man is what we all know. At first sight, this seems rather silly and empty, but it is not so.Salomon Luria, the major scholar of Democritus, observes that it is not a banality that Democritus is giving us. The nature of a man is not his internal structure but the network of personal, familial and social interactions within which he exists. It is these which make us, these which guard us. As humans, we are that which others know of us, that which we know of ourselves, and that which others know about our knowledge. We are complex nodes in a rich web of reciprocal information.All of this is not yet a theory. These are tracks we are following, I believe, in seeking to understand the world around us better. There still remains a great deal to understand. Ill speak of this in the final chapter.. MysteryThe truth is in the depths. DemocritusIve described what I think is the nature of things in the light of what we have learned to date. Ive summarized the development of some key ideas of fundamental physics, and I have illustrated the great discoveries made by physics in the twentieth century and the image of the world emerging from the research into a quantum theory of gravity.Am I sure about all this I am not.One of the very first and most beautiful pages in the history of science is the passage in Platos Phaedo in which Socrates explains the shape of the Earth.Socrates says he believes the Earth is a sphere, with great valleys where men live. Hes basically right, if a bit confused. He adds, Im not sure. This page is worth much more than all of the nonsense on the immortality of the soul which fills the rest of the dialogue. It is not just the oldest text to come down to us which speaks explicitly of the fact that the Earth must be spherical. More importantly, it shines with the crystalline clarity with which Plato acknowledges the limits of the knowledge of his time. Im not sure, says Socrates.This acute awareness of our ignorance is the heart of scientific thinking. It is thanks to this awareness of the limits of our knowledge that we have learned so much. We are not certain of all which we suspect, just as Socrates was not sure of the spherical nature of the Earth. We are exploring at the borders of our knowledge.Awareness of the limits of our knowledge is also awareness of the fact that what we know may turn out to be wrong, or inexact. Only by keeping in mind that our beliefs may turn out to be wrong is it possible to free ourselves from wrong ideas, and to learn. To learn something, it is necessary to have the courage to accept that what we think we know, including our most rooted convictions, may be wrong, or at least nave: shadows on the walls of Platos cave.Science is born from this act of humility: not trusting blindly in our past knowledge and our intuition. Not believing what everyone says. Not having faith in the accumulated knowledge of our fathers and grandfathers. We learn nothing if we think that we already know the essentials, if we assume that they were written in a book or known by the elders of the tribe. The centuries in which people had faith in what they believed were the centuries in which little new was learned. Had they trusted the knowledge of their fathers, Einstein, Newton and Copernicus would never have called things into question and would have never been able to move our knowledge forwards. If no one had raised doubts, we would be still worshipping pharaohs and thinking that the Earth is supported on the back of a giant turtle. Even our most efficacious knowledge, such as that found by Newton, may eventually turn out, as Einstein showed, to be simplistic.Science is sometimes criticized for pretending to explain everything, for thinking that it has an answer to every question. Its a curious accusation. As every researcher working in every laboratory throughout the world knows, doing science means coming up hard against the limits of your ignorance on a daily basis the innumerable things which you dont know, and cant do. This is quite different from claiming to know everything. We dont know which particles we might see next year at , or what our next telescopes will reveal, or which equations truly describe the world we dont know how to solve the equations we have, and sometimes we dont understand what they signify we dont know if the beautiful theory on which we are working is right. We dont know what there is beyond the Big Bang we dont know how a storm works, or a bacterium, or an eye or the cells in our own bodies, or our thought processes. A scientist is someone who lives immersed in the awareness of our deep ignorance, in direct contact with our own innumerable limits, with the limits of our understanding.But if we are certain of nothing, how can we possibly rely on what science tells us The answer is simple. Science is not reliable because it provides certainty. It is reliable because it provides us with the best answers we have at present. Science is the most we know so far about the problems confronting us. It is precisely its openness, the fact that it constantly calls current knowledge into question, which guarantees that the answers it offers are the best so far available: if you find better answers, these new answers become science. When Einstein found better answers than Newton, he didnt question the capacity of science to give the best possible answers on the contrary, he confirmed it.The answers given by science, then, are not reliable because they are definitive. They are reliable because they are not definitive. They are reliable because they are the best available today. And they are the best we have because we dont consider them to be definitive, but see them as open to improvement. Its the awareness of our ignorance that gives science its reliability.And it is reliability that we need, not certainty. We dont have absolute certainty, and never will have it unless we accept blind belief. The most credible answers are the ones given by science, because science is the search for the most credible answers available, not for answers pretending to certainty.Though rooted in previous knowledge, science is an adventure based on continuous change. The story I have told reaches back over millennia, tracing a narrative of science that has treasured good ideas but hasnt hesitated to throw ideas away when something which works better was found. The nature of scientific thinking is critical, rebellious and dissatisfied with a priori conceptions, with reverence and sacred or untouchable truth. The search for knowledge is not nourished by certainty: it is nourished by a radical distrust in certainty.This means not giving credence to those who say they are in possession of the truth. For this reason, science and religion frequently find themselves on a collision course. Not because science pretends to know ultimate answers but precisely for the opposite reason: because the scientific spirit distrusts whoever claims to be the one having ultimate answers, or privileged access to Truth. This distrust is found to be disturbing in some religious quarters. It is not science which is disturbed by religion: there are certain religions that are disturbed by scientific thinking.To accept the substantial uncertainty of our knowledge is to accept living immersed in ignorance and, therefore, in mystery, to accept living with questions to which we do not know the answers. Perhaps we dont know them yet or who knows we never will.To live with uncertainty may be difficult. There are those who prefer any certainty, even if unfounded, to the uncertainty which comes from recognizing our own limits. There are some who prefer to believe in a story just because it was believed by the tribes ancestors rather than bravely to accept uncertainty.Ignorance can be scary. Out of fear, we can tell ourselves calming stories: up there beyond the stars, there is an enchanted garden, with a gentle father who will welcome us into his arms. It doesnt matter if this is true, it is reassuring.There is always, in this world, someone who pretends to tell us the ultimate answers. The world is full of people who say that they have The Truth. Because they have got it from the fathers they have read it in a Great Book they have received it directly from a god they have found it in the depths of themselves. There is always someone who has the presumption to be the depository of Truth, neglecting to notice that the world is full of other depositories of Truth, each one with his own real Truth, different from that of the others. There is always some prophet dressed in white, uttering the words, Follow me, I am the true way.I dont criticize those who prefer to believe in this: we are all free to believe in whatever we want. Maybe, after all, there is a grain of truth in the joke reported by St Augustine: What was God doing before creating the world He was preparing Hell for those who seek to scrutinize deep mysteries. But these deep mysteries are precisely the depths in which Democritus, in the quote that opens this chapter, invites us to seek the truth.For my part, I prefer to look our ignorance in the face, accept it and seek to look just a bit further: to try to understand that which we are able to understand. Not just because accepting this ignorance is the way to avoid being entangled in superstitions and prejudices but because to accept our ignorance in the first place seems to me to be the truest, the most beautiful and, above all, the most honest way.To seek to look further, to go further, seems to me to be one of the splendid things which gives sense to life. Like loving, or looking at the sky. The curiosity to learn, to discover, to look over the next hill, the desire to taste the apple: these are the things which make us human. As Dantes Ulysses reminds his companions, we are not made to live like brutes, but to seek virtue and knowledge.The world is more extraordinary and profound than any of the fables told by our forefathers. I want to go and see it. To accept uncertainty doesnt detract from our sense of mystery. On the contrary: we are immersed in the mystery and the beauty of the world. The world revealed by quantum gravity is a new and strange one still full of mystery, but coherent with its simple and clear beauty.It is a world which does not exist in space and does not develop in time. A world made up solely of interacting quantum fields the swarming of which generates through a dense network of reciprocal interactions space, time, particles, waves and light figure .It continues, it continues, teeming life, and deathTender and hostile, clear and unknowable.And the poet goes on:So much the eye can see, from this watching tower.A world without infinity, where the infinitely small does not exist, because there is a minimum scale to this teeming, beneath which there is nothing. Quanta of space mingle with the foam of spacetime, and the structure of things is born from reciprocal information which weaves the correlations between the regions of the world. A world which we know how to describe with a set of equations. Perhaps, to be corrected.Figure . An intuitive representation of quantum gravity.Its a vast world, with much still to clarify and explore.'"
